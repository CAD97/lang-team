# Initiatives

A lang team **initiative** is some active effort with a clear goal or deliverable.
Typically initiatives are changes to the language, but they could also be documentation, specifications, or something internal to the lang team.

## Proposed initiatives

You can see the [currently proposed initiatives] on Github.

## Active initiatives

You can see the active initiatives, and their state, on the lang team [project board].

### Learning more about an active initiative

Each initiative has a tracking issue that describes its state in more detail along with regular updates. The tracking issue also identifies two key people for the intiative:

- The [owner], who drives the design.
- The [liaison], who synchronizes with the lang team and helps resolve thorny questions.

If you have questions, the issue also identifies the [Zulip] stream where conversation is taking place. If you look at the comments of the issue, you may also find requests for help or other forms of participation.

[liaison]: initiatives/roles/liaison.md
