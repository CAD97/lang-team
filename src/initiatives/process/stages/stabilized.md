# Stage 5: Stabilized

This is the final stage. The development is done and support transitions to the regular team members. The initiative is now considered [inactive]. However, the stream often sticks around as a convenient place to ping the people who were involved in implementing the feature for follow-up questions and for fixing bugs or other maintenance. The expectation is that if you helped to develop a feature, you will stay involved for some period of time after it hits stable to help in resolving problems that arise.

After stabilization, the owner and liaison should meet to do a final retrospective on how everything went and what could have been improved.
