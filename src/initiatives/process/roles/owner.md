# Initiative owner

The **owner** of an initiative is the person who is ultimately responsible for its design and implementation. They are driving and managing its overall process from conception to completion, though they may work with others to manage pieces of tha process (for example, the implementation is often done by someone else).

The owner is not the decision maker, but they have a huge influence on the design. They assemble the "menu" of overall solutions to the problem and help to narrow the choices down to the ones that are most viable. They are also encouraged to make recommendations on what they consider to be the right choice. These recommendations should include an explanation of what analysis they did on the other options that led them to this recommendation.

Owners do not have to be members of the lang team, but they do have to be sufficiently experienced and dedicated to drive the initiative with minimal assistance. Owning an initiative is also a common stepping stone on the path to full lang team membership.

## Pre-requisites

- Sufficient experience to perform or mentor the above tasks independently
- Demonstrated good judgement

## Tasks

Note that in practice these may be delegated or done in concert with a group:

- Exploring the design space and preparing the final design
- Escalating tricky decisions by defining the 'menu' of choices and alternatives for the team to consider (with recommendations, where appropriate)
- Documenting the design space and alternatives that were not chosen (and why)
- Interacting with people on Zulip or elsewhere who are offering feedback and ideas, incorporating those ideas where appropriate into the final design
- Developing and writing the code for the feature
- Documenting the feature in the Rust reference or other sites as appropriate

## Estimated time commitment

The time commitment will vary depending on the initiative. Some initiatives are effectively full-time endeavors (40 hours per week). Others can move along at a pokier pace. For an initiative to be considered _active_, however, it should have some form of update most months. After several months of inactivity, we will discuss with the owner whether the initiative should be moved to "inactive" state or whether we should seek another owner.
