# Calendar

We have a lang-team calendar that shows the time for our various meetings.
Meetings are generally open to anyone who wants to listen in. We also try to
post [minutes](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/tree/master/minutes) (and recordings, if any) on a "best-effort" basis from our
meetings.
