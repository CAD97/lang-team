# Active project groups

Would you like to find out what the lang team is working on? Check out
our [github project board]. It shows the active projects at each stage
of development, along with an explanation of the various stages. Each
project has a representative issue that links to more complete
information. The stages of a project are as follows: 

[github project board]: https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2
[proposing a project]: ./proposing_a_project.html

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Proposal | Deciding whether to start this project |
| Exploration | Exploring the problem space and deciding what RFC(s) to write |
| RFC | There is a pending RFC describing the design |
| Implementing | There is an accepted RFC, but implementation work is ongoing |
| Evaluation | The RFC is fully implemented and we are requesting public feedback |
| Stabilized | The feature is complete and available on stable compilers |

If you'd like to read more about the stages of a project, or you would
like to propose a new project, see the ["proposing a new
project"](./proposing_a_project.md) page.
