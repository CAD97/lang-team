# Project groups

These days, we are making an effort to do most of our design work in the context
of an active Project Group. You can find a list of active project groups by
searching the [issues tagged with project-group on the lang-team repo][pg]. Each
issue contains links to the repositories and other information about the group,
as well as regular status updates in the form of comments.
