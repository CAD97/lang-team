# Meetings

The lang team has two standing meetings. The current timing for these
can be found on the [lang team calendar](./calendar.html). We
generally record our public meetings and post the recordings in our
[YouTube playlist] (along with automatically created subtitles). We
also publish notes and minutes in written form in this github
repository.

## Triage meeting

The weekly triage meeting is when we go over the newly filed project
proposals along with issues that have been nominated for lang-team
feedback. We also get regular updates from the active project groups
so we can stay on top of what is going on.

[Triage meeting minutes are available in this directory.][tmm]

### Nominating an issue, PR, RFC etc for the triage meeting

You can nominate an issue/PR/RFC etc for the triage meeting by adding
the `T-lang` and `I-nominated` labels. When you do so, it's best if
you leave a comment explaining what kind of feedback you would
like. We try to go over all nominated issues and leave a comment
of some kind in response.

## Design meeting

The second weekly meeting is our **design meeting**. The design
meeting topics are used for in-depth discussions on a particular
topic, often in connection with an active working group.

### Proposing a topic for a design meeting

You can propose a topic for a design meeting by opening an [Design
meeting proposal] issue on the lang-team repository. During our weekly
traige meetings, we scan open issues to try and decide whether to
schedule meetings in the upcoming weeks.
