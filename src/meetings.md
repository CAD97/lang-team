# Meetings

The lang team has several standing meetings. The current timing for these
can be found on the [lang team calendar](./calendar.html). We
generally record our public meetings and post the recordings in our
[YouTube playlist] (along with automatically created subtitles). We
also publish notes and minutes in written form in this github
repository.

## Triage meeting

The weekly triage meeting is when we go over the newly filed project
proposals along with issues that have been nominated for lang-team
feedback. We also get regular updates from the active project groups
so we can stay on top of what is going on.

[Triage meeting minutes are available in this directory.][tmm]

### Nominating an issue, PR, RFC etc for the triage meeting

You can nominate an issue/PR/RFC etc for the triage meeting by adding
the `T-lang` and `I-nominated` labels. When you do so, it's best if
you leave a comment explaining what kind of feedback you would
like. We try to go over all nominated issues and leave a comment
of some kind in response.

## Planning meeting

We hold a monthly **planning meeting** in which we do two things:

- Updates from [active initiatives](./initiatives.md).
- Schedule design meetings for the remainder of the month.

After each planning meeting, we post a blog post to the [Inside Rust](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/)
blog announcing the upcoming meetings and any particularly interesting updates.
Minutes from the planning meetings are posted in the [design-meeting-minutes][dnm] directory.

## Design meeting

We reserve a weekly slot to hold **design meetings**. They are scheduled during
the planning meeting and hence known in advance. Design
meeting topics are used for in-depth discussions on a particular
topic, typically in connection with an [active initiative](./initiatives.md).

Every design meeting begins by reading a document and leaving comments. That document
must be prepared 24 hours in advance of the design meeting and posted on the issue.
During the meeting, we append notes and minutes to the end of the document, and
that combination is posted in [the design-meeting-minutes directory][dnm].
