# Meetings

The lang team has several kinds of standing meetings.

* [Triage meetings](./meetings/triage.md)
* [Design and planning meetings](./meetings/design.md)
* [Backlog bonanza](./meetings/backlog-bonanza.md)

Unless otherwise noted, all of our meetings are open to the public for anyone to attend. You will find the timing and event details on our [lang team calendar](./calendar.html). We publish notes and minutes in written form in this github repository.

## Recording policy

Dy default, our triage and design meetings are **not recorded**, in order to encourage engagement from a broad audience. We may record certain design meetings, evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and only with the agreement of all participants. Any intention to record a design meeting will be established at that time that meeting is scheduled during the monthly planning meeting and included in the blog post announcing the upcoming meetings.

Our [YouTube playlist] has recordings of some of our past meetings (along with automatically created subtitles).
