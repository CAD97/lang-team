# Proposing a topic for a design meeting

You can propose a topic for a design meeting by opening an [Design
meeting proposal] issue on the lang-team repository. We schedule meetings in our monthly
planning meeting.

[design meeting proposal]: https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/new/choose

Every design meeting begins by reading a document and leaving comments. That document
must be prepared 24 hours in advance of the design meeting and posted on the issue.
If you propose an issue, you should be willing to prepare that document, or else indicate
who will do the preparation.

Typically, design meetings are associated with active initiatives: you may wish to
[propose an initiative](./propose.md) instead.
