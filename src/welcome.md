# Welcome

Welcome to the repository for the Rust Language Design Team.  This
page stores our administrative information, meeting minutes, as well
as some amount of design constraints. It's always a
work-in-progress (insert omnipresent mid 90s logo for under
construction here).

Key links:

* [Active initiatives project board](https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/16/)
    * Shows you the things that are currently under development (or exploration) within Rust.
    * You can [read more about initiatives here](./initiatives.md).
