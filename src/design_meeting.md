# Design meeting

The lang team has a weekly slot reserved for a **design meeting**. The design
meeting topics are used for in-depth discussions on a particular topic, often
in connection with an active working group.

## Timing

See the [lang team calendar](./calendar.md) for the current time of the design
meeting.

## Proposing a topic for a design meeting

You can propose a topic for a design meeting by opening an [Design
meeting proposal] issue on the lang-team repository. During our weekly
traige meetings, we scan open issues to try and decide whether to
schedule meetings in the upcoming weeks.
