Lang team discussion takes place on two forums.

## Discord

General discussion takes place on the #design channel 
can be found on [the rust-lang Discord][d]. The `@lang-team` alias
can be used to ping the lang team, though that is meant to be used
sparingly. Note that not all members actively monitor this channel.

Some working groups also use dedicated Discord channels.

## Zulip

Some working groups are active on [the rust-lang Zulip][z].

## IRC is deprecated

The `#rust-lang` IRC channel on `irc.mozilla.org` is in a
"quasi-deprecated" status and is not recommended.
