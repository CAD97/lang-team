The general lang team discussion channel can be found on [the
rust-lang Discord][d]. It is called `#design`. The `@lang-team` alias
can be used to ping the lang team, though that is meant to be used
sparingly. Note that not all members actively monitor this channel.

Some working groups are also active on [the rust-lang Zulip][z].

The `#rust-lang` IRC channel on `irc.mozilla.org` is in a
"quasi-deprecated" status and is not recommended.
