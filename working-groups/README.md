# Working Groups

This directory contains the notes for each of the active working
groups. Each folder contains a few files, along with files specific to
that working group:

- `README.md` -- describes the basic details of the working group and how to get involved
- `NOTES.md` -- updated regularly with the latest news
- `FAQ.md` -- a place to document the answer to frequently asked questions

## What is a working group?

The lang team establishes a **working group** when we have a promising
idea that we would like to pursue. This idea might be a new language
feature, but it could also be other things, such as an effort to write
a specification for some part of Rust.

## How can I get involved?

If you see some working group that looks like it is doing something
you would like to be involved in, take a look at its README.md
file. It should give more context about what the working group is
trying to do, where it is in the design process, and how you can
contribute or follow along.
