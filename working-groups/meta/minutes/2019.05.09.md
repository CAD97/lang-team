# Meta WG 2019.05.09

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iiWsbOeYbI)

## Agenda

- “Roadmap” — 
    - what documents / things do we expect to produce and in what order?
- Look at upcoming (or previous) efforts and think about how they should function
    - try blocks — controversial / syntax
    - specialization — complicated
    - const generics
    - grammar — specification
    - unsafe-code-guidelines — partly specification, but with a different flavor
- Links
    - [+A new RFC discussion model](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/A-new-RFC-discussion-model-Nihr4wCQXeklWo6wWrFY2) may be interesting to read


## Process

- we decide to start a WG
- initially it is an exploratory phase;
    - looking at the problem, enumerating key examples
    - sketching out possible ways to address (and their effect on the examples)
    - “positive”
- transition to “active phase”
    - agree upon: “general shape” of solution
    - “key examples” to fixed
    - also explain why the problem is worth fixing
- Agreeing on problems is important
    - but there is a need to be iterative when uncovering the problems
- sometimes you have rfcs that are motivated by “making syntax more uniform” or “removing special cases”
    - motivation is not unlocking something for users
    - still, the more specific effects we can cite, the better
    - the special cases that are to be fixed could in a sense by the “key examples”
- want to avoid the “unstoppable train” effect that can happen
    - but js has some specific aspects, e.g. babel toolchain
    - really trying to go into user research, e.g. ergonomic changes
- Niko: I’d like to see us working harder on the docs
    - would like to see the roles declared
- can the same person play many roles
    - for smaller things, seems fine
    - for larger things like async-await, could be a problem
- how much overhead to add?
    - will slow things down?
    - new/old things
- what are roles
    - lang team representative
    - implementor(s) in the compiler 
    - mentor/reviewer for the implementation
    - writing end-user explainers
    - writing reference material
    - writing test cases
    - writing blog posts
    - summarizing meetings and decisions
- reference vs end-user
    - these are different mindsets
    - perhaps different folks
- discussion about trying to make “status updates” more a part of the process
    - personal blogs vs/and/or
    - lang-team blog
- example: try functions
    - begin with establishing the problem:


    fn foo() -> Result<(), Error> {
       bar()?;
       baz()?;
       Ok(())
    }
    
    try fn foo() -> Result<(), Error> {
       bar()?;
       baz()?;
    }


    - iterate over various proposals
    - some of the questions that have arisen in the past:
        - mental models etc ← can we evaluate this more clearly?
    - would scope just be too small:
        - error handling in general
- example: error handling
    - sketching out the challenges people face here
    - finding key examples 
    - there will likely be a lot of “subparts” here
- first step: establishing a roadmap
- example: traits working group
    - would be useful to enumerate what the key examples, problems being solved are
- implementations outside compiler to ‘prove out’ an idea, using procedural macros
    - e.g., arguments in main
    - doc comments to define  `.context()` for errors
    - try functions
- Some things we didn’t talk about and could talk about:
    - “overall WG procedure”
    - how to have controversial conversations
        - conflict resolution
    - how to manage deeply technical conversations
    - how do we select what to do and when
        - scheduling breaks, cadence of features
            - how much is it ok to miss things :)
    - do we want formal staging mechanism and what is it
        - (and can we skip steps where appropriate)
    - when/how should a working group end
-
