# Grammar Working Group
![working group status: active][status]

The goal of the working group is to satisfy [RFC 1331] and produce a testable,
canonical grammar for the Rust language. The primary audiences for the grammar
are:

- Rust RFC authors who wish to propose and communicate changes.
- rustc and Rust tool developers who need an authoritative definition of the
  grammar.
- To assist documentation efforts to communicate valid Rust syntax to users,
  and to facilitate the [Rust language specification].

- **Leads:** [@centril][centril], [@qmx][qmx]
- **Meeting Notes:** [All][meeting-notes]
- **Dedicated repository:** [rust-lang-nursery/wg-grammar][wg-grammar]

# How can I get involved?

If you'd like to get involved, the best idea right now is to introduce yourself
in our discord channel -- and perhaps consider attending on our meetings.

## Do I need to attend any meetings?

We have a bi-weekly sync meeting. Check the [lang team meeting
calendar][calendar] for the most up to date time. Attendance is not mandatory
but recommended as this can be a good opportunity to ask questions and find new
issues to work on.
