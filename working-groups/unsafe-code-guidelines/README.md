# Unsafe Code Guidelines (UCG) Working Group
![working group status: active][status]

The goal of the Unsafe Code Guidelines (UCG) effort is to
collaboratively produce a "reference guide" for writing unsafe code
that what kinds of things unsafe code can and cannot do.

- **Leads:** [@nikomatsakis][nikomatsakis], [@avadacatavra][avadacatavra]
- **Meeting Notes:** [All](NOTES.md)
- **Dedicated repository:** [rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines][ucg]

# How can I get involved?

You will find complete instructions on how to participate in [the
rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines repository][ucg]. The conversation is
mostly taking place asynchronously over GitHub issues although we do
also have weekly synchronization meetings and the occasional video
chat.
