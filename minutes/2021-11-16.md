### Attribute for trusted external static annotations

* [rust-lang/lang-team#118](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/118)
* Lokathor made a PR, as discussed last week
* Given `extern static FOO: [u32; 10]` or whatever
    * if you declare it correctly, not static mut
    * shouldn't need to use unsafe when you access it
        * currently you do need to
* Proposal:
    * Let's add an attribute on the declaration saying it is trusted
* But:
    * Either it's already correct without the attribute
        * we don't require it on Rust immutable statics
* Ralf had a concern that there could be some patterns used by C that are no longer expressible
* Counter proposal:
    * Make declaring an extern static count as unsafe code
    * e.g. `unsafe extern`
* What is unsafe for?
    * Mara: 
    * Lokathor: if there's no amount of check that can make a dangerous thing not dangerous...what do we gain from it?
* nikomatsakis:
    * I think we want to be able to say, per item:
        * all uses are safe, definition is unsafe
        * versus unsafe to USE
    * the question is: if uses are unsafe, do we also need to audit definitions?
        * answer: maybe yes, because llvm
    * in my mind, good case for
        * definitions should always be unsafe
        * you can declare that uses should be safe
* backwards compat?
    * coul
* nikomatsakis's proposal:
    * warning for extern block unless declared as unsafe
        * to account for LLVM and because, indeed, if these are wrong, code is wrong
    * adding an attribute like `#[trusted_extern]`
        * can be applied to any sort of extern, makes uses safe
* [Draft RFC](https://hackmd.io/@Lokathor/Sk-RXL_PK)

* Josh seconded it; it's in FCP, unless someone objects, will go to the "experimental" zone (needs an RFC).
* scottmcm pointed out that this forbids future evolution of a type parameter with a default.
* Other concerns: 
    * Can this lead to user confusion, how can we test that?
        * Generics vs associated types are probably confusing 
        * Without a clear-ish rule, will people be more confused?
        * 
    * You won't know how to name the type
    * How important are names?
        * For things like `Iterator` and `Future`, decent argument that seeing the names don't help you in reading the code.
        * Mara: maybe it should just work for things with exactly one type, and nothing else.
* Mara: can we have rust-analyzer autocomplete this instead, and keep it same for readers?
* Josh: don't want this limited to IDE users
* How confusing will it be between generics and associated types?
    * Mark: How do I learn the difference between generics and associated types? Today, perhaps, based on other existing traits
* How important are the names to readers?
    * e.g. is this just about *writing* or also reading
    * Loka: Standard library code uses all of "Target", "Output", and "Item", for roughly the same concept.
* nikomatsakis: I remember that around the time we were stabilizing things we considered always using `Output` precisely so that we can have a simple default, but we never did it. 
* mark: regarding "how important are they", is the *name* important, or is it good enough to know it is an associated type? 
    * `Iterator<=u32>` or `Iterator -> u32
    * Mara: doesn't seem worth it
* mara: I also don't like the extra attribute (e.g., positional) makes me have flashbacks to C++, lots of variations.
* pnkfelix: something I would want investigated: the proposal makes claims about incoming Rust programmers and how they might understand these differences, I think any argument based around this change improving the learning curve, needs substantiation.
    * I don't feel conflating things improves learning curves, though "IANAE" (I am not an educator).
* niko: I tend to feel that forcing people to pay attention to things isn't a winner, but hiding them isn't necessarily either.
* mark: my intuition is that, in some future scenarios, the distinction between generics and associated types may become important in new ways, as well.
* pnkfelix to summarize and post on the github and zulip.

### Make specifying repr optional for fieldless enums #88203 

Example of code that is accepted with this PR (but not before):

```rust
enum Enum {
  Unit = 1,
  Tuple() = 2,
  Struct{} = 3,
}
```

Specifically what's changed is that you don't have to specify a repr. This would be accepted on master if you used an explicit repr type.

Loka: wait no it wouldn't: [even with the repr attribute](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=49cb4ad957f89dd3c84df9550c5f587f) the code above doesn't compile on nightly.

Questions:

* Does `as` work for this enum?
    * Hypothesis: no
* If you put a repr on this, though, it is unstable
    * Wouldn't we expect this to be "no more stable" than an explicit representation?

### Tracking issue for allowing overlapping implementations for marker trait [#29864](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29864)

no idea why this is nominated

probably https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89515 (after https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89357#issuecomment-932990251) ?

###  Disallow non-c-like but "fieldless" ADTs from being casted to integer if they use arbitrary enum discriminant #89234 

Related to what we were just talking about?

```rust
#![feature(arbitrary_enum_discriminant)]

#[repr(u8)]
enum Enum {
    Foo = 1,
    Bar(),
    Baz{}
}

fn main() { }
```

This works, but only on nightly, and the feature + repr are both required. If this issue is just about accidental stabilization, then I think this issue can be closed.
