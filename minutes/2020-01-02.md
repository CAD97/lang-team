    * merge: Uplift lints from clippy to rustc (rust-lang/rust#53224)

* [ ] niko to post summary comment on turbofish RFC and postpone
    * update: thought about it, didn't act yet because pondering

## Design meeting topics

## Scheduler

* Jan 6 -- `Pin` and rogue `DerefMut` impls #66544 (proposed)

### Urgent-ish

* ffi-unwind and the "C" ABI (proposed)

* dyn Trait + coherence interaction #57893

* stacked borrows overview + `&self` in AtomicUsize + maybe the embedded interactions (proposed)

### Speculative 

* roadmap + next edition (proposed)
    * see also [this list](https://hackmd.io/J8AgNxIeTe69RrpRjaBzAA) which only Niko filled out :)

* unsafe code and `&raw` in next edition (proposed)

## Shepherded item updates

### inline assembly (Amanieu, Josh)

* no update

### safe transmute (Ryan, Josh)

* [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2835#issuecomment-566192688 check your boxes?
    * josh, boats, pnkfelix, scott

### const evaluation (ecstatic-morse)

* `&mut` ref types and borrows are on nightly but no RFC -- need one?
    * Let's have an RFC.
* We should think more about our story for recursion limits?
    * could lift the standard recursion limit for now
    * but what about `loop { .. }`
        * currently: we have a step counter that overflows at some point (counts terminators)
        * tied to an unstable attribute right now
* Erroneous constants & what counts as dead code? (see discussion below).

### ffi-unwind (BatmanAod)

* preparing blog post, have to schedule a meeting

### "dyn Trait" stuff (nikomatsakis)

* Relevant issue: [rust-lang/rust#57893](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)

* no update

### grammar (qmx)

* no update

### `never_type` (`!`) stabilization (nikomatsakis)

* no update

### or-patterns

## Shepherding proposals

None this week

## Triage

    * (see above)

### [Nominated PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

* [x] [Stabilize `#![feature(slice_patterns)]` in 1.42.0 -- #67712](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67712)

    * check your boxes :)

* [x] Treat extern statics just like statics in the "const pointer to static" representation [#67630](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67630)

    * Felix can ask about triggering (new?) UB in user code and whatnot.

* [x] WIP: no longer promote non-pattern const functions [#67531](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67531)

    * Decided to r+

* [ ] [Expr walking structural match (reopened) #67088](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67088)

    * MIR version: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67343 (WIP)
    * short version:
        * trying to add a refinement to the type-based check, too conservative, was breaking existing use cases
            * alternative: value-based check looking to include things like `None::<IllegalType>`
            * some questions arise around `const fn` calls and a few other cases, and of course const generics
            * related:
                * `[None::<String>; 22]`
                * static initializers
            * const initializers
        * there are two "competing" PRs right now, one based on HIR (maybe HAIR) and one based on MIR

* [ ] [mem::zeroed/uninit: panic on types that do not permit zero-initialization #66059](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66059)

    * no updates since [last meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/blob/master/minutes/2019-12-19.md)
    * TL;DR of what we said before
        * Centril thinks it would be good to have the full plan as "prose" and FCP that one so we don't have to re-FCP every step.
    * Update: [crater regressions categorized](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66059#issuecomment-568445970)
    * Who will follow up with Ralf? Maybe centril?
    * To land this PR we need: (Centril to leave comment)
        * Preliminary write-up of the rules around which types permit zero-initialization
        * Something we can point to to help people understand when `mem::zeroed` and `mem::uninitialized` will panic
        * (To what extent was this covered in an RFC? Maybe only "suggested"? "Inspired by?")

### [Nominated issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang+)

* [ ]  (request) Extend `#[must_use]` to Pin [#67387](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67387)
    * [ ] Niko to summarize their concerns, note the `Deref` trait, and generally encourage doing something for pin now and considering a more general extension separately

* [ ] [Casting or adding type ascription to panic!() triggers unreachable_code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67227)

    * deferred till we have more folks
    * Centril listed some options
        * author gave feedback.

* [ ] [Add configurable, per-item instruction limit for CTFE](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67217)

    * would prefer if you are able to attach these definitions to the const fn *definition* more than the use, in contrast to with macros --Niko
    * current infinite loop detector is very slow

* [ ] [PartialEq implementation for RangeInclusive is unsound](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67194)

    * [this is due to unsound specialization implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67194#issuecomment-565595437)
    * maybe a good idea to organize some form of audit
    * another question might be how we could try to implement the "always applicable" rules in compiler / chalk, they haven't received much attention

* [x] [`Pin` is unsound due to rogue Deref/DerefMut implementations #66544 ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)

    * see above

* [ ] [Tracking issue for RFC 2645, "Transparent Unions and Enums" #60405](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60405)

    * centril is thinking of stabilizing `#[repr(transparent)]` for enums:
        * Nice to have univariant enums & structs behave the same way in general as a form of "algebraic data types" are sane.
    * `#[repr(transparent)]` applied to a univariant enum behaves as if it were a struct
    * defer stablization for unions

* [x] [Arc::drop has a (potentially) dangling shared ref #55005 ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55005)

    * still nominated, planning to schedule a meeting

* [ ] [Tracking issue for RFC 2091: Implicit caller location #47809 ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47809)

    * just wanted to call attention to this, clear nomination bit after meeting

* [ ] [floating point to integer casts can cause undefined behaviour #10184 ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184)

    * [last time we talked](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184#issuecomment-559538629), we concluded that it made sense to
        * adopt saturated semantics as the default
        * maybe offer a `-Z` flag to opt out for a time
    * there has been plenty of discussion in the meantime
    * how do we go forward here?
        * a summary might be an amazing contribution --niko

### [Nominated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

* [ ] [Calling methods on generic parameters of const fns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2632)

    * We can continue with nightly experimentation without the RFC merged.
        * Niko will comment that we are OK with ^---.
    * Want another meeting? (Monday, 17/18:00 PM)

* [ ] [Make the turbofish syntax redundant](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2544)

* [ ] [target_feature 1.1](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2396)

### [rfcbot pending list](https://rfcbot.rs/)

* [ ] Some older items that haven't moved in a while, can we do something?
    * [ ] [RFC: Elide Array Size](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2545)
        * It seems like maybe we just want to close this?
        * There is a problem here, do we want to take another stab at reaching consensus?

    * [ ] [Tracking issue for RFC 2046, label-break-value #48594](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48594)

* Some recent additions:
    * [ ] [Make `handle_alloc_error` default to panic (for no_std + liballoc)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66741#issuecomment-558184215)

    * [ ] [Stabilize the `#[alloc_error_handler]` attribute (for no_std + liballoc) #66740](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66740)

* Recap:
    * [ ] [Uplift lints from clippy to rustc (rust-lang/rust#53224)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53224#issuecomment-415097721)

        - Scott to close? What's up with that?

## Future meeting proposals

- dereference with ralfjung / compilerâ€™s llvm-wg / ucg wg?
