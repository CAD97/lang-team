# Lang Team Triage Meeting Minutes

* [Watch recording](https://youtu.be/2An-l39Rs0o)

## Action items

* [ ] propose case-by-case uplift for clippy lints (scottmcm) & cancel FCP
    * merge: Uplift lints from clippy to rustc (rust-lang/rust#53224)

## Resolutions

## Shepherded item updates

### const evaluation (ecstatic-morse)

* Triaging/fixing bugs in const if/match
    * Now available on nightly; `#![feature(const_if_match)]`

### ffi-unwind (BatmanAod)

* no major updates this week
* still waiting to finish the work on measuring the performance impact of ABI choice

### "dyn Trait" stuff (nikomatsakis)

* Relevant issue: [rust-lang/rust#57893](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)
* Update:
    * started analyzing the breakage more closely
    * seem to have identified a few patterns of interest
        * `impl<T: ?Sized + Foo> Bar for T` -- a common case, and perhaps one where we could avoid requiring `dyn trait` prefix in older code?
    * in any case: seems like an important next step will be starting to draft an RFC
        * perhaps consider newer process?
        * Should have a meeting to discuss the problem, not just the solution, and also to brainstorm multiple potential solutions.

### grammar (qmx)

* no updates
* some refactoring work on rustc parser taking place

## Shepherding proposals

- (~10 min) December 5th: Safe Transmute (let’s delegate Ryan Levick as shepherd)
    - looking to solve problem of *safely* transmuting from one type to another (`&T` to `&U`, or `&T` to `&[u8]`, or `&[u8]` to `&T`)
    - also (where possible) supporting mutable transmutes
    - is this a problem lang+libs would like to solve and create a shepherded group
    - current proposal needs compiler support primarily to verify that a trait can be safely implemented (analogous to `Copy`)
        - but if it turns out we don't need lang support, we can always recharter this group
    - there are extensions that we would want to make in future rounds
        - and some of them would require changes to the language
        - in particular safe union reads
    - Proposed scope includes safe transmutes, safe transmutes of mutable references, and safe union field reads
    - compiler complexity: low (just verifying type requirements)
    - would want to survey past work and other crates
    - [internals thread](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-v2-safe-transmute/11431)
    - sense of the meeting: positive
    - next steps:
        - brief RFC (model it on the [RFC for the ffi-unwind team](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2797))
        - github repository `project-safe-transmute`
        - zulip stream
- (~15 min) December 5th: Inline assembly working group (let’s delegate Amanieu as shepherd)
    - pre-rfc posted on internals, based on an earlier pre-rfc
    - end-state:
        - `asm!` macro using a syntax we feel we can maintain, easily write, and stabilize
        - today we expose LLVM's assembler quite directly (and regularly hit issues with implementation, including ICEs), we would be moving away from that
    - architectures:
        - the goal is to support this on every major target
    - Why this feature now?
        - Keeping a lot of people on nightly (or on C) at the moment
        - Fits into the "C parity" goals
        - (Rust offers a compelling advantage here because of its portability story)
    - Proposed scope:
        - defining new assembly syntax
        - providing a transition story for the current `asm!`
        - defining fallback for backends without native support (e.g., cranelift)
        - secondary, future steps:
            - naked functions (transition story or interoperability story)
            - global asm
    - compiler complexity: moderate
        - what happens if we add other backends?
            - the pre-RFC describes how to implement it using an external assembler
            - in short you get a function call and rustc compiles the asm as a separate object file
    - next steps:
        - brief RFC (model it on the [RFC for the ffi-unwind team](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2797))
        - github repository `project-asm` 
        - zulip stream

## Triage

### [P-high issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AP-high+label%3AT-lang)

* [ ] [Regression in Error conversion from Infallible](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66757)
    * Do we feel ok with doing *nothing*?
        * Breakage has to do with inference and hence it is 'allowed'
        * niko: I don't feel comfortable w/ the quantity
        * josh: also when we made the decision to stabilize we didn't expect breakage
        * centril: the breakage we were talking about was in the dynamic semantics
        * niko: it was unanticipated
    * Currently this is on nightly
    * Possible fixes enumerated by 
        * 1 -- unacceptable
        * 2 -- time doesn't seem sufficient before this hits beta
            * what does it mean to "complete mitigations"?
            * we have a number of mitigations in place, but we don't have a lint that detects the regression that happened in objc
        * 3 -- we don't have consensus on it, but it would be doable in time
        * 4 -- time doesn't seem sufficient before this hits beta
        * 5 -- give up on a major use case for `!`
            * only known way to (at least partially) recover would be making `!` and uninhabited types inter-coercible
            * but that is a bigger piece of work with unknown end result
        * 6 -- unaccepable by T-libs
        * 7 -- would buy time to work towards 2, for instance
            * but centril would ask someone else to do the work
                * niko raises hand

* [ ] [`Pin` is unsound due to rogue Deref/DerefMut implementations rust-lang/rust#66544](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)
    * this requires resolution
* [ ] Coherence can be bypassed by an indirect impl for a trait object
    * rust-lang/rust#57893
    * see above
