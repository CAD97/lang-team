* [ ] niko to pursue scheduling design meeting around `Pin` and trying to gather up constraints -- found only one slot that may work, pinged folks

* [ ] niko to comment on RFC 2632 about "ok to experiment on nightly"

## Design meeting topics

### Urgent-ish

* ffi-unwind and the "C" ABI (proposed)

* dyn Trait + coherence interaction #57893

* stacked borrows overview + `&self` in AtomicUsize + maybe the embedded interactions (proposed)

* `Pin` and rogue `DerefMut` impls #66544 (proposed)

### Speculative 

* roadmap + next edition (proposed)
    * see also [this list](https://hackmd.io/J8AgNxIeTe69RrpRjaBzAA) which only Niko filled out :)

* unsafe code and `&raw` in next edition (proposed)

## Shepherded item updates

### inline assembly (Amanieu, Josh)

* no update

### safe transmute (Ryan, Josh)

* https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2835#issuecomment-566192688 check your boxes?
    * josh, boats, pnkfelix, scott

### const evaluation (ecstatic-morse)

* `&mut` ref types and borrows are on nightly but no RFC -- need one?
    * Let's have an RFC.
* We should think more about our story for recursion limits?
    * could lift the standard recursion limit for now
    * but what about `loop { .. }`
        * currently: we have a step counter that overflows at some point (counts terminators)
        * tied to an unstable attribute right now
* Erroneous constants & what counts as dead code? (see discussion below).

### ffi-unwind (BatmanAod)

* no update -- planning to have the dedicated meeting still

### "dyn Trait" stuff (nikomatsakis)

* Relevant issue: [rust-lang/rust#57893](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)

* no update

### grammar (qmx)

* no update

### `never_type` (`!`) stabilization (nikomatsakis)

* no update

## Shepherding proposals

None this week

## Triage

### [P-high issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AP-high+label%3AT-lang)

* [ ] [Usage of erroneous constant can be omitted on nightly and beta #67083](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67083)

    * [x] [Replace our fragile safety scheme around erroneous constants #67191](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67191)
        * Discussion with oli today
        * During MIR generation, some constants are omitted (e.g., those with never types)
        * Used to have a pass over the "HIR" that found all constants
            * any errors -> led to an abort
            * but some changes in the middle made these lints
        * So now, if constant is used, you get a hard error
            * but we don't look at constants in dead code
                * "but what code is dead"
        * Hence proposal to use the NLL notion of "dead code"
            * problem is that some constants are already "elided" at MIR generation time
        * the example causing the problem:

```rust
let _: ! = panic!(); // obviously ok, but errors at runtime
```

```rust
const FOO2: u8 = panic!();
fn main() {
    let _ = FOO2; // gets an error today
    ...
}
```

```rust
const FOO: ! = panic!();
fn main() {
    let _ = FOO; // was not getting errors
                 // had miscompilations for uninhabited types
    ...
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    panic!();
    BAD_CONSTANT; // <-- no error (dead according to NLL)
}
```

Conclusion:

* uses of constants that are unreachable (according to NLL) would not trigger errors, even if the constant encounters an error during evaluation
    * because backwards compatibility (and because using one notion of reachability is nice...)
* in particular, NLL's notion of reachability is not dependent on optimizations nor particular values (e.g., `X` is reachable in `if false { X }`) and contains various "false edges" in match building and so forth

* [x] [`Pin` is unsound due to rogue Deref/DerefMut implementations rust-lang/rust#66544](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)

    * Proposal: schedule a meeting to discuss in detail
        * Niko will reach out to Ralf & Boats.
        * Ideally they attend the meeting.

* [ ] Coherence can be bypassed by an indirect impl for a trait object
    * (see above)

### [Nominated PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

* [ ] [Expr walking structural match (reopened) #67088](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67088)

    * MIR version: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67343 (WIP)

* [ ] [mem::zeroed/uninit: panic on types that do not permit zero-initialization #66059](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66059)

    * Not complete implementation yet, OK in dynamic semantics?

    * Crater triage?

    * [Ralf responded](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66059#issuecomment-565486337) to recent comments:
        * This is a minimal step
        * Overall goal is that we panic on all illegal uses of mem::uninitialized and mem::zeroed that we can detect
        * The question is how fast we can land this without breaking everything

        * Centril thinks it would be good to have the full plan as "prose" and FCP that one so we don't have to re-FCP every step.
    * Connected to the safe-transmute
        * since anything that can be initialized from arbitrary bits surely permits zero
        * long term if we had a "trait" that indicated something could be zero-initialized, perhaps with opt-in (e.g., deriving), we could leverage it for safe-transmute etc
            * i.e., compiler could ensure that implementing the trait is valid
            * This is related to the compiler figuring out whether traits regarding safe-transmute are valid
    * Proposal: this is alright in dynamic semantics for now, we'd like to see this happen via static semantics and the type system eventually too, please coordinate that with project-safe-transmute
    * Considerations:
        * would we leave room to remove panics in the future, if we relax the validity invariants for zeroing
        * would be good to decide the "mission" of "panic if zero'd"
            * taking inspiration of `MaybeUninit` and `mem::uninitialized`
        * and have some up-to-date place to look for what types do what and where
            * "we think this should panic, it doesn't yet"
            * etc

* [ ] [Add a raw "address of" operator #64588](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64588)

### [Nominated issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang+)

* [ ] [Casting or adding type ascription to panic!() triggers unreachable_code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67227)

    * deferred till we have more folks
    * Centril listed some options
        * author gave feedback.

* [ ] [Add configurable, per-item instruction limit for CTFE](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67217)

    * would prefer if you are able to attach these definitions to the const fn *definition* more than the use, in contrast to with macros --Niko
    * current infinite loop detector is very slow

* [ ] [PartialEq implementation for RangeInclusive is unsound](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67194)

    * [this is due to unsound specialization implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67194#issuecomment-565595437)
    * maybe a good idea to organize some form of audit
    * another question might be how we could try to implement the "always applicable" rules in compiler / chalk, they haven't received much attention

* [x] [`Pin` is unsound due to rogue Deref/DerefMut implementations #66544 ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)

    * see above

* [ ] [Tracking issue for RFC 2645, "Transparent Unions and Enums" #60405](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60405)

    * centril is thinking of stabilizing `#[repr(transparent)]` for enums:
        * Nice to have univariant enums & structs behave the same way in general as a form of "algebraic data types" are sane.
    * `#[repr(transparent)]` applied to a univariant enum behaves as if it were a struct
    * defer stablization for unions

* [x] [Arc::drop has a (potentially) dangling shared ref #55005 ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55005)

    * still nominated, planning to schedule a meeting

    * just wanted to call attention to this, clear nomination bit after meeting

* [ ] [floating point to integer casts can cause undefined behaviour #10184 ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184)

    * [last time we talked](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184#issuecomment-559538629), we concluded that it made sense to
        * adopt saturated semantics as the default
        * maybe offer a `-Z` flag to opt out for a time
    * there has been plenty of discussion in the meantime
    * how do we go forward here?
        * a summary might be an amazing contribution --niko
