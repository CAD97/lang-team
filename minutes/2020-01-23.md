One thing not covered here that I want to do:

- Plan out meetings for all hands
    - I want to do this more rapidly anyway, let’s discuss async in #t-lang a bit perhaps
## Shepherded item updates

~~**inline assembly (Amanieu, Josh)**~~

- lots happening here, expect 1st RFC show up soon
    - [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2836#issuecomment-565269781) to create project group in FCP
    - deprecate existing ASM, move to LLVM ASM ([RFC 2843](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2843)) opened
    - Initial inline assembly RFC ([RFC 2850](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2850)) opened

**safe transmute (Ryan, Josh)**

- no updates.

**const evaluation (ecstatic-morse)**

- PR implementing syntax for const bounds landed `?const Trait` 
    - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67820
    - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68140

**ffi-unwind (BatmanAod)**

- no update but continued plan to work on writing up the [notes from big meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66037)

**"dyn Trait" stuff (nikomatsakis)**

- Relevant issue: [rust-lang/rust#57893](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)
- Relevant PR: [rust-lang/rust#66037](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66037)
- Still trying to get a crater run on latest proposal, had a few misstarts due to rebasing errors
- What the PR implemented:
    - Making `dyn Trait` not `dyn safe` if:
        - there is a dyn overlapping impl and 
        - the trait has associated non-functions
            - that do not have where `Self: Sized` (not implemented)
- What we discussed:
    - If there is a dyn-overlapping impl:
        - and the trait is dyn safe
        - then the items in the impl must be default
- To aid in reaching a final decision, want to have a write-up covering some of the alternatives
    - crater impact where possible
    - patterns that work or don’t work
    trait Foo {
      type Bar;
    }
    
    impl<T: ?Sized> Foo for T {
      type Bar = X; // This impl is allowed in the first version
    }

**grammar (qmx)**

- no update

`**never_type**` **(**`**!**`**) stabilization (nikomatsakis)**

- out of the blue Aaron1011 opened [PR #68350](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68350)
    - has an interesting plan that ties warnings to functions that produce `!` but do not take a `!` argument
        - if we default some type parameter `X` to `!`
        - and you have a function call in your code `f(…)` where:
            - return type of this function call includes `X`
            - the arguments to `f` are inhabited
    - alternatives:
        - make it a hard error — too complex and would require a very strong sense of false positives
        - deny by default to start  — probably too strong
        - warn by default
            - but this might be silenced by allow-warnings
    - the concern: if they have `#[allow(warnings)]`, they won’t see this
        - we could have an “unsilenceable warning” (or at least one with a minimum level)
        - but this would be a new thing
    - some question about how strong this lint should be, e.g., should it be silenceable?
        - We are still waiting on crater (https://crater.rust-lang.org/ex/pr-68350, *Running (23%))*


    // functions that take
    fn foo<T>(x: T) -> T { .. }
    
    // 
    fn bar<T>() -> T { }
    let x = bar();
    
    fn baz<T>() -> Result<(), T> { Ok(()) }
    let x = baz();
    
    fn baz<T>() -> fn() -> T { transmute() }
    baz()()
## Shepherding proposals

[**Nominated issues**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang+)

- [`Pin` is unsound due to transitive effects of `CoerceUnsized` #68015](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68015)
    - split off from the other `Pin` issue
- [~~Pin~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)~~`~~ [~~is unsound due to rogue Deref/DerefMut implementations #66544~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)
    - see above
- [~~Arc::drop has a (potentially) dangling shared ref #55005~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55005)
    - meeting planned for Feb 10
- [~~floating point to integer casts can cause undefined behaviour #10184~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184)
    - [last time we talked](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184#issuecomment-559538629), we concluded that it made sense to
        - adopt saturated semantics as the default
        - maybe offer a `-Z` flag to opt out for a time
        - there has been plenty of discussion in the meantime
        - how do we go forward here?
            - a summary might be an amazing contribution --niko
    - Centril will leave comment asking for a summary of:
        - recommended option from the POV of the summary maker and why :)
        - what options have been evaluated and what were the results
        - what options exist that have not been evaluated and what are the pros/cons
        - Not done yet.

[**Nominated RFCs**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

- RFC for unsafe blocks in unsafe fn [#2585](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2585) 
    - Recent activity but generally positive sentiment from lang team members
    - Do you ever want a `unsafe fn` with no unsafe blocks in the body?
        - Yes: consider `Vec::set_len`, though unsafe fields might obviate this
        - If we had unsafe fields, we could probably give warnings if you have an `unsafe` fn with no `unsafe` blocks
    - Do we wish to merge?
    - What about `#[unsafe]` attribute as an alternative, opt-in syntax?
        - concern: `unsafe` is a keyword.
        - concern: “two ways to do it”
        - motivation?
            - avoiding breakage
            - `unsafe` keyword continues to be reserved for “(truly) here be dragons”
    - Rightward drift:
        - If you make a more narrow rewrite like `let x = unsafe { foo() }` that will help somewhat (we ought to be able to automate this, too)?
        - Maybe if you are writing a lot of smaller functions...
    - Niko: thoughts on potential edition interactions
        - side note: (re)consider `unsafe` vs `trusted`
        - I do like having the split between introduce and discharge keywords, like we have with `async.await`, so would in principle be in favour of `trusted{}` blocks, though who knows if it’s worth the churn — scottmcm
            - churn is indeed the main counterargument from my POV — nikomatsakis
    - Fighting rightward drift:
    unsafe fn foo() = unsafe {
       ...
    };
    fn foo() = match some_expression_here {
       ...
    };
    fn foo() = try { ... };
    
    fn foo(x: u8) -> u8 = x * 2 + 4;
    - Cluster of inter-related proposals here:
        - unsafe within unsafe fn body
        - fn body after `=`
            - fights rightward drift
        - unsafe fields
            - permits warning if unsafe is not used within fn body
    - Potential immediate steps:
        - Remove the lint that says “don’t add `unsafe` into the body”
            - maybe add a lint that warns if you do something `unsafe` in the body that is allow-by-default, so folks can opt-in
        - Consider whether to land the RFC
    - Compromise?
        - retool the RFC to a lint that warns by default?
        - this permits people to opt out in specific, FFI-like scenarios, but gives people a nudge
        - we can still have an automated transition, it could later become stronger etc
    - I’ll note that `fn foo(x: u8) -> u8 { x * 2 + 4 }` is already legal and fine and not materially longer, unlike in C# where the `=>` removing the `return` and `;`  (and the `get{}` in properties) is more materially valuable — scottmcm
        - it’s not obvious to me that  `= x * 2 + 4` should be allowed, it might be something we limit to “the sorts of things that don’t require `,` in a match”, for example — nikomatsakis
    - Resolved:
        - Remove the existing lint
        - Add a allow-by-default lint for unsafe code in an unsafe fn without an unsafe function
        - Write a comment on #2585 that summarizes the conversation from meeting
- [~~Make the turbofish syntax redundant~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2544)
- [target_feature 1.1](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2396)
    - Centril wants someone to more convincingly say they’ll implement this.
        - ~~Centril will ask T-compiler on Zulip.~~
