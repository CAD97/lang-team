- scott to post comment on “elide array size” RFC (done)
- Niko to comment on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74622 to say that this feels like largely libs call but we’d like consistency with `print!` and `panic!` in terms of when something is a format string or not

## Notes from meeting:

**Add `#[cfg(panic = '...')]`** [**#74754**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74754) ****

- Probably overkill for an RFC / group etc
- This lets you conditionally compile based on panic strategy (unwind/abort)
- Feature gated? The PR is insta-stable.
- Consensus of meeting:
    - Propose merge with proviso that it should have a feature gate

 **[CRATER] make `ConstEvaluatable` more strict** [**#74595**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74595) ****

- Awaiting crater results

**RFC: Overconstraining and omitting `unsafe` in impls of `unsafe` trait methods** [**#2316**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2316) ****

- Question: What does `unsafe` mean? Related to [RFC 2585](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2585)
- Suppose you define a trait with an `unsafe` method because you mean for that method to be *unsafe to implement*. 
    - Claim: People do this, whether or not they *should have done that*.
- Isn’t this what unsafe traits are for?
- Scott’s understanding
    - Unsafe method: preconditions that caller must uphold when invoking the method
    - Unsafe trait: impl has obligations to caller
- Gap in the language, no way to make a “conditionally unsafe trait to implement”
    - `TrustedLen` is a case where we decided to introduce an unsafe trait (and not an unsafe method) because we didn’t want to bless the “method that is unsafe to implement” pattern
    - Another example is `Step` trait, which became unsafe because we rely that “adding one really adds one”, similarly `TrustedOrd` that is proposed from time to time
- Analogy: `const`
    - You would (by analogy) be able to write an impl that uses `const fn` where the trait does not
- Does the RFC allow you to take advantage of a safe fn in impl?
    - We think it does not (yet), but there would be interesting semver implications otherwise.
    - Or maybe it does!
- Analogy: you are allowed to be more general with lifetime annotations
    trait Foo {
      fn foo<'a>(&self, l1: &'a u32, l2: &'a u32) -> &'a u32;
    }
    
    impl Foo for () {
      fn foo<'a, 'b>(&self, l1: &'a u32, l2: &'b u32) -> &'a u32 { l1 }
    }
- Niko: a bit nervous about impl considerations, might be inclined to just permit the impl
- Interesting semver, if you implement with just `panic!()` you could forget the unsafe by accident.
    - but would we want to make that decision in one step so as to not change semver meaning of existing code
- Sense of the meeting: 
    - postpone, we like the idea, but we’re not sure about the semver interactions
    - however would like to add documentation about the purpose of `unsafe fn` vs `unsafe trait` in lang reference to clarify the intended meeting
    - scottmcm to follow-up

[**Portable SIMD project group #29**](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/29) 


- How strong is the motivation / problem? What is evidence for that?
    - Medium
- What priority does this correspond to and how?
    - “C Parity, interop, and embedded” but only in the sense of “exposing some capability that’s really imp’t if you want it, but less so if you don’t” (not wildly general purpose)
- What are the challenges and how severe are they? e.g.,
    - Controversial, ties us to LLVM
    - Lots of details to consider
- Who might serve as liaison?
    - ??? unclear, how much does it even NEED a lang liaison
- Who are the key stakeholders to include?
    - Massive libs interaction, we would want a liaison from libs
    - Other stakeholders from different schools of thought on how to deal with SIMD
- Other
    - Having fixed-width SIMD at various widths is valuable and doing full-on variable width might be worth handling separately
    - Proposal here is to have 128bit, 256, etc, and implement it everywhere we can even if that requires some polyfills
        - Josh feels this is the right overall approach
    - Lots of details to get right:
        - What are the right vector types to have and how can you move between them?
    - What’s needed from language?
        - Could be done as a library using the intrinsics that are already exposed
        - But the other approach is to use LLVM intrinsics that are in some way portable-ish and are designed to compile to the right instructions
    - Not a lot of lang-team requirements here, this is more of a libs question, so lang-team might have more of a “review” capability here
- Niko to post summary
