## Upcoming design meetings

Drew up an [April/May meeting schedule](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/04/10/lang-team-design-meetings.html):

- ~~April 20 —~~ [~~Edition planning~~](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Rust-2021-Edition-Planning--AyOauNWGN4Ly6XZlg4mMG9bUAg-MpuBJRy026HbUUWmFMtai)
~~~~- ~~April 27 — Type aliases~~
- ~~May~~ ~~~~~~4~~ ~~— Try blocks, try traits, functions that try, oh my!~~
- ~~May 13 — Process, introducing a “stage 0” process a la~~ [~~this blog post~~](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/12/03/aic-improving-the-pre-rfc-process/)
    - maybe a generalization of the MCP RFC
- May 20 — impl Trait everywhere (nikomatsakis)
- May 27 — Prioritization / Roadmap followup (tentative)
- 
[](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/12/03/aic-improving-the-pre-rfc-process/)
List of potential topics for future meetings:

    - how to deal with type aliases and bounds
        - e.g. [Perform WF-check on `type`s with no type parameters #69741](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69741)
    - Unsafe code guidelines — how to make progress
    - “Copy out of references” — focus on use cases and inter-related problems
        - `let foo: &Option<u32>; match foo { Some(x) => bar(x), None => ... }`
        - `fn bar(x: u32)`
            - `x` has type `&u32` which is annoying
        - Are there examples / use cases where the fix is more complex than inserting an `&` into a pattern?
    - Sync with safe transmute WG


## Shepherded item updates

**inline assembly (Amanieu, Josh)**

- Blog post is blocked on some bugs, but those bugs are fixed

**safe transmute (Ryan, Josh)**

- conversations happening in #project-safe-transmute on Zulip
- 2020-04-16: current plans are working towards a “much reduced” proposal:
    - what is the minimal trait (or set of traits) to allow some of this to live in libs
    - still in brainstorming state
- Repo with marker traits
    - Some set of marker traits (similar to Copy wrt implementations) → enable operations
        - Opt in (for backwards compatibility, in particular around marker traits exposing internal implementation details unintentionally in a semver-breaking way)
    - Partial progress on determining marker traits. 
- 2020-06-01: Crate posted to the ecosystem experimenting with some of the traits discussed before
    - Trying to figure out if that is covering our needs and whether it can/should transition to compiler
    - Recent experiment used const generics to figure out things like “does a structure have alignment requirements” without requiring special compiler support — so maybe const generics can be used instead to enable?

**const evaluation (ecstatic-morse)**

- Oli working on [skill-tree](https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/146212tcompilerconsteval/90352Skilltree.html#196242568) to help plan next steps for const-eval
    - `loop` and `while` (not `for`) is the next candidate for stabilization.
        - Main blocker was questions around qualification à la  `if` and `match`.
        - Having `if` and `match` w/o `loop` and `while` will push people to use recursion for loops in a const context (I believe this happened with C++’s `constexpr`).
        - Having no `for` loops, which would require const trait methods, is painful though.
- New PR that would enable `Option::unwrap` to become unstably const
    - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71824
    - Does this want its own feature gate, or wrap into above?
    - This is enabled by moving const-checking after drop elaboration
        - Additional precision in what is availible
        - Concern: This makes drop elaboration more of the public facing languge/”spec”
- Opened RFC for `const { … }` 
    - https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2920
    - Do we allow code inside a `const { … }` to depend on generic parameters?
    - Do we allow `const { … }` in fallible patterns?
- [RFC 2342, "Allow `if` and `match` in constants"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49146#)
    - [Oli summarized the current status.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49146#issuecomment-614012476)
    - T-Lang needs to decide whether we want to stabilize with the current semantics around `Option::<NeedsDrop>::None` or to stabilize a version that falls back to type-based analysis when it sees a branch or loop.
    - Note: the “mixed scheme” is just an optimization, the end result will be the same as the “full value based analysis” for end users
    - 2020-04-23 
        - Wrote [stabilization report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49146). I think further discussion occurs during FCP? I’m not 100% sure of the process, so someone else should propose to merge if that is indeed the next step.
        - Implemented “mixed-scheme” optimization to reduce time spent const-checking.  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71330
    - 2020-04-30
        - Currently in FCP
    - 2020-05-11
        - Currently out of FCP
    - 2020-05-18
        - [First draft of](https://github.com/rust-lang/const-eval/pull/43) [skill tree](https://github.com/rust-lang/const-eval/pull/43) complete
        - maybe will stabilize if/match
    - 2020-06-01
        - const block RFC has reached a “fixed point”
        - will move to fcp merge
    - [#71824, Check for live drops in constants after drop elaboration](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71824#discussion_r421675954)
        - Drop elaboration removes most frivolous `Drop` terminators. It seems silly to duplicate this work during const-checking.
        - Allows `Option::unwrap` to become (unstably) const: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66753
        - Do we want to put this form of drop elaboration behind a feature gate?

**ffi-unwind (BatmanAod****)**

- 2020-04-02: Working towards RFC
- 2020-04-09: [BatmanAod opened a PR with draft of RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-ffi-unwind/pull/28)
- 2020-04-30: 
    - The only question is whether to make it “defined behavior” if a foreign except propagates across a “C unwind” boundary (and there is no `catch_unwind`)
        - Advantage: we probably want to support this
        - Disadvantage: it will require a shim to catch C++ exceptions — this is probably necessary later, unless we reverse the “two ABIs” proposal
    - Interesting downside of the “two ABI” design
        - If you have a C function but it takes callbacks, then there could potentially be pressure to make callbacks into “C unwind” and the function too (for flexibility)
            - but note that this is not a trivial change, necessarily, and indeed many C libraries are not ready for this to happen “just because”
        - True, but just a downside of this approach.
- 2020-06-01:
    - Plain Old Frames — for frames that don’t have a pending destructor or `catch_unwind`

**"dyn Trait" stuff (nikomatsakis)**

- No progress
- Relevant issue: [rust-lang/rust#57893](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)
- Relevant PR: [rust-lang/rust#66037](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66037)
- What the PR implemented:
    - Making `dyn Trait` not `dyn safe` if:
        - there is a dyn overlapping impl and 
        - the trait has associated non-functions
            - that do not have where `Self: Sized` (not implemented)
- Crater impact virtually negligible, but the 1 item we did identify is interesting
    - has to do with the `[TryStream](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/stream/trait.TryStream.html)` [trait](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/stream/trait.TryStream.html),  which is used roughly like this:
    trait StreamX {
        type Item;  
    }
    
    trait TryStreamX: StreamX  {
       type Ok;
       type Error;
    }
    
    impl<S, T, E> TryStreamX for S
        where S: ?Sized + StreamX<Item = Result<T, E>>
    {
        type Ok = T;
        type Error = E;
    }
- the crate in question has a `dyn TryStream` which is an error now
    - Why? The concern is that `S` in the above impl might (in the future) become
        - `dyn TryStreamX<Ok = A, Error = B> + StreamX<Item = Result<C, D>>`
    - in which case `type Ok` would be `A` from the default impl but `C` from the impl above
- I’m not sure if there is some path forward apart from breaking `dyn TryStream`, which is a bit of a shame
    - note that a trait alias is really what we *want* here
- other alternative that I haven’t tried to implement yet, but which I discussed before
    - in a dyn-overlapping impl, all associated items must be `default`
        - and compiler (for backwards compatibility) will add the `default` implicitly
            - (but user would not be permitted to specialize with their own impls, as boats noted)
        - this is to reflect that the compiler introduces its own impl
    - but impact on `TryStream` would be pretty severe here, I think
        - you wouldn’t be able to take `T: Stream<Item = Result<...>>`
        - you would not be able to do `T::Ok` 
- impact of existing PR
    - you cannot use `dyn TryStream` but you can do `fn foo<T: TryStream<..>>()>`
    - you could write `dyn Stream<Item = ..>`
- really this code wants to be a *trait alias* 
    - This would require trait aliases to support associated types, but that seems feasible
    - Trait alias semantics: “A Stream of Result<T, E> can be called a TryStream, where the associated types Ok and Error refer to T and E respectively”
- next step:
    - revisit the soundness hole and see if we can “weaponize” the `TryStream` example in a similar way
    - revisit the write-up covering the various options before us:
        - i.e., this change is modifying what dyn safety means, has very slight impact
            - concerns about the fact that “whether trait X is dyn safe depends on its impls”
        - other options might be introducing `default`, but this has potentially broader impact

**grammar (qmx)**

- Centril + petrochenkov have been working on parser architecture
    - simplified and unified item grammar for example in different contexts
    - Outline module loading will soon be driven by expansion, allowing:
    #[cfg(FALSE)]
    mod foo {
       mod bar; // `foo/bar.rs` doesn't exist, but no error regardless.
    }
- maybe stalled out?
    - can we maybe write up a description of how far we got, what the problems were
- 2020-04-02: Some discussion, some work started up again
    - Updating grammar definition to reflect the actual grammar that’s implemented in rustc

**never_type**` **(**`**!**`**) stabilization (nikomatsakis)**

- 2020-03-31: Niko left [detailed comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66173#issuecomment-606836855) with an alternative proposal

`**#[instruction_set]**` attribute for per-function instruction set changes

- pnkfelix to act as liaison and explore
- current status: investigation of some of the questions we raised below
- 2020-04-30: awaiting response to the comment that we made: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfgcs/pull/2867#issuecomment-618623702
- 2020-05-11: Still waiting for comments
- 2020-05-18: no updates
## Shepherding proposals

None this week

## [**P-high issues**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AP-high+label%3AT-lang)

~~~~[~~**`Pin` is unsound due to transitive effects of `CoerceUnsized`**~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68015) [~~**#68015**~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68015)

- no major updates, see [internals thread](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/the-pin-unsoundness-and-coerceunsized/11593)

[~~**Lifetime bounds in auto trait impls prevent trait from being implemented on generators #64552**~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64552)

- P-high but not a soundness problem, *mostly* an impl issue, though it is somewhat blocked on having a nice way to describe region solving
- Maybe Niko should prep a writeup or something
    struct Foo<'a, 'b: 'a> { }
- Skipped, no writeup

[~~**Coherence can be bypassed by an indirect impl for a trait object**~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)  **#57893**

- (see above)
## [Nominated PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

[**Report error when casting an C-like enum implementing Drop #72331**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72331) 

- Consider a bug fix
- Might prefer a warning period for one release
- We should update the reference — Niko to write comment

[**Add a `MustUse` trait to complement `#[must_use]` #71816**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71816) 
 

    // Can't be expressed with a trait
    #[must_use]
    fn is_valid() -> bool
    
    //
    enum Foo<T: MustUse> // seems weird
    
    struct Foo {
      r: Result<u32, u32>
    }
    
    struct Bar<T> { // T = Result<u32, u32>
      r: T
    }
    
    fn foo() {
      vec![is_valid()]; // warning because the `Vec<bool>` that is created is not used
    }
    


- ~~by the way, here is another example that we cannot express via traits in Rust today~~:
    - I think that `#[marker] trait MustUse {}` [solves](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/marker-trait-attr.html) that, though.
    - (ah, yes; it does)
    struct S<A, B> { }
    impl<A: MustUse, B> MustUse for S<A, B> { }
    impl<A, B: MustUse> MustUse for S<A, B> { }

[**clarify interaction of pin drop guarantee and panics #71607**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71607)

- ping cramertj and/or prep for next time
- The precise question:
    - [@rust-lang/lang](https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/teams/lang) the question for nomination is: do you all agree with what the docs say in this PR -- that it is okay to deallocate the memory backing pinned data after calling its `drop` even if that `drop` panicked?
- Could we panic in drop is abort?
    - Backwards compatibility guarantees vs correctness
    - What about just in !Unpin?
    - What about over the edition boundary?
        - No theoretical advantage, but better backwards compatibility
- What are the runtime diagnostics of and abort in drop?
- How do we get the data?
    - Crater?
    - Enable just on nightly? → see if anyone complains
    - RFC? → formally raise the question
- Double-panic is already abort, supporting for requiring this behavior being rare

[**Perform WF-check on `type`s with no type parameters #69741**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69741) 

- blocked on meeting April 27
- Schedule a meeting for May-ish
- `type X = Vec<dyn Foo>` // error even if you never use it
- `type X<T: ?Sized> = Vec<T>` // not an error unless used with `dyn Foo`
- Niko: I wouldn’t want to do this step by itself, I think it would be even more confusing than current state
    - but I do think we should discuss whether to do this as part of edition
## [Nominated issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang+)

[**Async execution can get lost during refactoring #71368**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/71368) 

- about must-use (desire for `Option<impl Future>` to warn if it is not used)
- `tokio::spawn(async move { foo() })` -- returns a `JoinHandle<impl Future>`
    - `tokio::spawn(async move { foo().await })` — returns a `JoinHandle<()>`
- Do we want more warnings to solve this?
    - previous proposal was deeper (i.e. more intrusive)
        - more false positives
    struct Foo {
      h: Result<u32, u32>
    } // would be considered must-use
    
    vs
    
    struct Bar<T> {
      h: T, // where T = Result<u32, u32>
    } // this could be separate from Foo, in theory
- Re: MustUse trait
    - The behavior on types vs functions is already different, so a trait could perhaps not be so confusing
    - Is must_use logically a property of types, functions, or both?
- 2020-05-18:
    - Three variants:
        - Opt-in: using a trait is the preferred mechanism (implemented in Jonas’s PR)
        - Opt-out: if a struct/enum has a field that is must-use, then the type is msut-use ([tested here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/62262#issuecomment-544647401))
        - Opt-out: if a struct has a generic parameter supplied that is must-use
    - One simple path forward:
        - Add an (unstable) `MustUse` trait and use it to extend to `Option` and other types in stdlib
        - Wouldn’t cover `tokio::JoinHandle`
    - Most important to settle the “what do we want”, but what would help there?
        - Proposal: Crater run testing a more extensive variant and categorizing the errors.
        - Or revisit the run [we did previousl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/62262#issuecomment-544647401)y.

[**Stabilize the `#[alloc_error_handler]` attribute (for no_std + liballoc)**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66740) [#66740](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66740) 

- 2020-06-01:
    - Two compatible proposals (#66741) that overlapped
    - #66741 is the more minimal surface area, we could do that, but then folks can’t specify what to happen on allocation error (beyond the default)
    - conclusion: pnkfelix to comment and examine

 
[**Tracking issue for RFC 2523, `#[cfg(version(..))]`**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64796)
[](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64796)
- 2020-06-01:
    - we settled previously that version test the *beta version*
    - dtolnay’s [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64796#issuecomment-634546711):
        - people’s nightly testing won’t cover the in-progress work
        - workflow would be to add `#[cfg(version)]` at some point after the feature is stabilized
    - but: changes don’t occur monotonically across the release
        - problem would be that your library expects people to use the latest nightly but people are running older nightly, so they start to get errors
            - in practice a lot of people do use pinned nightly versions
            - implication: people using nightly’s would have to be pinned to nightly releases, else someone might be using cfg-version
    - cfg-accessible is available
        - but this doesn’t cover everything, e.g., const-eval extensions
    - alternatives:
        - add a `-Z` assume full version
    - who can we delegate this to?
    - Niko to summarize today’s conversation

[**Arc::drop has a (potentially) dangling shared ref #55005**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55005)

- still blocked on resolution
- main two options:
    - add raw pointer methods and encourage folks to migrate (possibly deprecate, but maybe not, the existing ones)
    - add some annotation that signals no optimization for given parameters

[**Tracking issue for DST coercions (coerce_unsized, unsize) stabilization #27732**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27732) 

- Nominating for discussion, regarding splitting this issue into:
    - `Unsize` trait, reflects unsizing, may want to wait on "custom DSTs", irrelevant for "opt into unsizing coercions", can stay unstable forever (or even removed)
    - `CoerceUnsized`, can be generalized to an "opt into structural coercion" `Coerce` trait, would cover all the cases "`CoerceUnsized` with `Unsize` bounds" cover today (and more), can be stabilized more readily
- Ask eddyb to write up the two things and how they interact and make the two issues

[**repr(packed) allows invalid unaligned loads #27060**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27060) ****

- Q: would raw references (which are on our trajectory), could they resolve this?
- A: we do not have a source-level operator to actually *take* a raw reference. (i.e. we do not have `&raw <expr>`
- I think the complaint with `&unsafe x` is that there was the request to do `unsafe foo()` without needing braces.
- One possibility would be to make an RFC to reserve `officially-undefined` as a keyword and use that for all klunky syntax.
- Niko proposes that we do not bikeshed this and specifically stabilize a clunky syntax for proc macros etc to use (e.g. `$raw_borrow()`).
    - Felix notes that we could have a dual to `r#foo` raw identifers, where we have a prefix that specifically denotes “this is a reserved word”. e.g. `r#$asm`.
        - Niko notes that this is a pattern of explicit primitive operations, which encourage userspace experimentation and allow coming to bikeshed with experience.
        - Just-created thread in zulip for expanding `foo#bar`: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213817-t-lang/topic/Making.20new.20.60_.23.60.20prefixes.20not.20a.20breaking.20change
- `&raw` can’t work in current edition
    - Edition boundary?
    - Series of tokens for unstable keywords
    - `raw_ref!`?

[Nominated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

- [inline const expressions and patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2920)
    - Does inline const syntax allow revering to in scope generic parameters
    - Can’t do this until array length expressions are allowed to do this
        - This shouldn’t happen until it works for array_length
            - l`et arr = [x; 22]` ← array length is the `22` in here
            - Options: Block, or not have this feature
                - Would remove similarity with `async{}` and `unsafe{}`
        - Don’t do it yet and do it when this works for array length
        - Generic parameter could determine whether a match is exhaustive
    - Do we want `const{}` in a pattern in a match arm?
        - named consts can already be used
        - Perhaps we could ban named consts in patterns, so as to not accidentally bind variables
            - Enum variants are more of a problem. 
        - Are there compelling examples?
            - Not yet.
            - But using everywhere a named const can is compelling
            - Base value + different offsets
    - `if let const { Some(22 + 22) } = Option::None { }`
    - Conflict?: Can’t depend on associated consts of generic parameters in patterns. 
    - Currently under one feature gate, we could make it separate, though.
        - Most of the issues are what if we find something?
        - Defer discussing splitting it to stabilization.
## [rfcbot pending list](https://rfcbot.rs/)
    - items to discuss this meeting:
    - RFC Elide Array Size stalled since [Dec 2018](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2545#issuecomment-449133335)
        - discuss today with Josh
        - `const C: [u8; _] = [1, 2, 3]`
        - in a `let` you can do `let c = [1, 2, 3]` no problem
        - in a `const`, there are some concerns:
            - easy to change the type of the const (each time you add an entry to the list)
            - on the other hand, many constants are private
            - otoh this is true for all items
                - yes but this is particularly annoying :)
        - main debate:
            - const generics would allow this
                - this was raised in 2018 but we still don’t have const generics
            - this was intended as a “let’s do this and we’ll be able to generalize later”
        - what about let?
            - Niko: I would want it to be specific to const/static because otherwise it’ll be more invasive and it doesn’t buy as much for a `let`
        - scott: can we make this a kind of “impl constant”, so that the value is not known until “monomorphization time”?
            - more complex to impl, but plausible
            - wouldn’t impact the API
            - but what syntax would we want??
                - `impl usize`, of course! :cry:

    - Calling methods on generic parameters of const fns #2632 ([fcp comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2632#issuecomment-481395097))
        - As far as I know we are permitting experimentation and implementation to go through here
        - Can we merge the RFC in an experimental state? How can we best reflect this status?
