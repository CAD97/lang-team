## Proposed FCPs

**Check your boxes!**

- Mark deleted several from here - the ones needing discussion are nominated, so will be below. Several have outstanding action items (mostly on Niko).

### "RFC: Add `target` configuration" rfcs#2991

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2991

- Blocked on consideration of more ergonomic target configuration as outlined [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2991#discussion_r496090143)
  - would be an alternative to permitting specification of explicit target, potentially seen as avoiding negative effects of overly-specific cfgs.

## Active FCPs

### "rustc: Allow safe #[target_feature] on wasm" rust#84988

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84988

- Trailing comment by Ralf: We should ask for clarification of the LLVM spec that this is not UB at the LLVM level. Could end up like other LLVM UB but not Rust UB bugs; Ralf thinks this is likely a reasonable tradeoff to make.

## P-critical issues

### "ICE when reifying function pointers to copy / copy_nonoverlapping using an if" rust#84297

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84297

- With some intrinsics, the way they are implemented, you can't get an actual function pointer
  - That can cause breakage when something becomes an intrinsic where it used to be a wrapper
- We can fix this by always making things wrappers around intrinsics, but this impacts codegen etc
- Or we can make the compiler generate shims automatically

Example:

```rust=
fn main() {
    let _unused = if true {
        core::ptr::copy::<i32>
    } else {
        core::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping::<i32>
    };
}
```

- Niko: I think we should just get rid of intrinsics as a concept and have lang items, and then use eddyb's trick to generate shims (direct calls are special indirect calls make a function pointer):

```rust=
#[lang(likely)]
fn likely(...) {
    likely(...)
}
```

- There's a distinction that some functions (e.g., `copy`) make sense to invoke by pointer and some don't (e.g., `likely`).
  - It doesn't make much sense to invoke `likely` by pointer, but then it doesn't hurt, right?
- Meeting summary:
  - Lang would prefer that functions act like functions, and hence that the compiler can generate wrappers.
  - Not our purview for whether this is fixed in the compiler or not.
  - Question: Can all intrinsics be represented with a fn pointer -- notably not sure about SIMD?
  - Mark to leave comment

## Nominated RFCs, PRs and issues

### "RFC: Overconstraining and omitting `unsafe` in impls of `unsafe` trait methods" rfcs#2316

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2316

- [matklad requested real world examples](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2316#issuecomment-823507045)
  - originally motivated by the future trait, but Pin made that unnecessary
- Primarily blocked on concerns about learnability
  - (but also ~no checkboxes ticked)
- Proposal to shift to trusted/unsafe model, perhaps.
- Meaning of unsafe is very context dependent.
  - But this RFC in some sense codifies the relationship more clearly
    - It makes them _unsafe to call_ and not _unsafe to implement_
- How does this combine with requiring an unsafe block inside the method?
  - You can put an unsafe block inside the function but not have an unsafe on the impl
    - That will compile
  - But is this different from any other unsafe function?
  - cramertj: I find it weird to have to write unsafe when there is not specific condition to write
- Niko: I'm fairly convinced this is not making the space worse, though I'm also convinced trusted could be useful
  - scott: +1 to the idea of splitting up the keywords better here. Would be nice even just to make it easier to say out loud without the confusion. And with `try`/`?` and `async`/`await` it seems quite reasonable to have `unsafe`/`trusted` or similar for introduce and discharge. (Though `unsafe` isn't "carried" so it's not a perfect parallel.)

### "Calling methods on generic parameters of const fns" rfcs#2632

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2632

- Sort of not-clearly blocked. Really old pending FCP (since April 2019) - https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2632#issuecomment-481395097
  - May make sense to close this RFC, in favor of a fresh one given all the changes since then, at least to start a fresh thread.

### "Tracking issue for RFC 2523, `#[cfg(version(..))]`" rust#64796

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64796

- Ongoing discussion of cfg(version(...)) stabilizing before cfg(accessible(...))
  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64796#issuecomment-844173493
- One possibility: implementing a subset of cfg(accessible) that requires the accessibility item be in std/core/alloc
  - cramertj: stdlib + rustc?
  - josh: it'd be nice if we had feature detection for the language, but right now cfg(version) is the only thing we have for that
    - we could use the names of feature gates but we dropped that from the earlier proposals due to opposition
    - I'd still like to see it, but less concerned about blocking cfg(version) on that
    - utility of cfg for language features is much lower because of the fact that we have to be able to parse the item body
      - mara: you can avoid it with an identity macro though
  - mara: people use versioning to check for const -- that's not possible with cfg(accessible), right?
    - josh: that doesn't work now, is that an important use case?
    - mara: a lot of scripts use versioning for that (I can make myself const if my callees are const)
  - taylor: Feel like we should stabilize -- already immediately useful. Crates can't use cfg(version) until it's in their MSRV window as is.
    - niko: +1, given that build.rs versioning is in active use, the utility of delaying seems low to me
