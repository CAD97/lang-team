[#73](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/73) will be scheduled next week.

## Nominated RFCs

- "try_trait_v2: A new design for the ? desugaring" [rfcs#3058](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3058)
    - Primarily for discussion in design meeting, but can do brief overview in this meeting.
    - Overview:
        - Trying to address feedback from the tracking issue
        - Extension to keep the '`Option`-ness' or '`Result`-ness', but can't be used for the default `?` desugaring (could be used for try block)
        - Lets trait implementations determine whether or where to do `From` conversion
        - Hybrid of the various options

## P-high issues on rust-lang/rust
- No P-high issues this time.

## Nominated PRs and issues on rust-lang/rust
- "Tracking issue for RFC 2535, 2530, 2175, "Or patterns, i.e `Foo(Bar(x) | Baz(x))`"" [rust#54883](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54883)
    - Appears that we have resolved pat2018/pat2021 matchers
    - What do we need for this to be done?
        - Stabilization report is missing
        - Some form of migration lint for 2021 Edition
    - Do we want to block stabilizing on having the migration available?
        - Do we even *want* the migration? 
        - Or is the change insufficiently invasive?
        - Concern: if you move a crate with public macros, you may not realize your dependencies are affected
        - Sufficient to block on someone saying that a lint is *feasible*?
    - Niko to message mark-i-m about stabilization report and matcher
        - Avoid stabilizing pat2018/pat2021 until edition 2021 is in place, just in case we will slip or something else
- "Support `pub` on `macro_rules`" [rust#78166](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78166)
    - Josh and Niko were reaching out, trying to find someone to help do the language side of this
- "expand/resolve: Turn `#[derive]` into a regular macro attribute" [rust#79078](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79078)
    - cramertj left a comment, petrochenkov asked about status
    - waiting on petrochenkov to implement the reordering restriction
    - mark to leave a comment with an update
- ""!" is the only type that is unsafe to raw-ptr-deref into a "_" pattern" [rust#79735](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79735)
    - pnkfelix was looking into having 'syntactic' checking for `unsafe` usage
    - turns out that `let _: T = ...` does check for unsafe
        - "type ascription" is treated as a use
    - `let x: &i32; let _ = *x;` <-- this compiles
        - `let x: &i32; let _: i32 = *x;` [also compiles](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=7d9edc3e8efc900f282d4028a5dba610)
        - for extra fun: `let x: &_; let _: i32 = *x;`
        - `let mut x = 22; let y = &mut x; let _ = x; drop(y);`
    - consenus from meeting:
        - this is a bug, we expect unsafe checking to be "syntactically scoped"
        - compiler team can decide the appropriate remedy (niko has opinions)
        - interactions with initialization and borrow checking however are not bugs (as described in #79735)
- "Unsafe checking skips pointer dereferences in unused places" [rust#80059](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80059)
    - this is covered above
- "Allow qualified paths in struct construction (both expressions and patterns)" [rust#80080](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80080)
    - Request someone to write a summary comment of precisely the new behavior (mini stabilization report)
    - Otherwise ready to fcp merge
    - Mark to make this request on PR
- "make const_err a future incompat lint" [rust#80394](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80394)
    - Mark to prepare a summary of how this fits into promotion and other in-flight changes, post on PR, we will revisit next week
    - e.g., is this part of the implementation work for https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3027 ?
- "avoid promoting division, modulo and indexing operations that could fail" [rust#80579](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80579)
    - fixes one of the problems that #80394 would introduce if we were to land it
    - crater run was executed with [6 regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80579#issuecomment-755459386), and those regression have since been fixed (by backing out the float part of this, as well as array indexing)
    - meeting consensus:
        - land it
    - Niko to post comment
- "relax adt unsizing requirements" [rust#80726](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80726)
    - Request description of exactly what the new mechanic is and if there are use cases, examples, or other motivation.
    - Josh to write a comment.
