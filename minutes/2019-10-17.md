# Shepherded items
* [ ] const evaluation ‚Äî 
    - A PR to make `const-eval`  a full-fledged working group has [been opened.](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/pull/201)
        - Who should lead this WG? (RalfJung has too many commitments)
        - Weekly meeting?
        - There‚Äôs already a de facto repository at https://github.com/rust-rfcs/const-eval. This should get transferred to the `rust-lang` org.
    - After [#64470](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64470), there‚Äôs a separate, dataflow-enabled pass that can check `const` bodies for errors. Its results are compared against the original pass, and an [ICE is triggered](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64470#discussion_r326858517) if they disagree. I‚Äôve been triaging issues arising from this:
        - Zero-sized arrays were not [handled properly](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65389)  (resulting in [#65348](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65348) and [#64945](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64945))
            - @Taylor C I believe you brought up the first issue in the previous lang-team meeting. It should now be resolved.
        - The dataflow-enabled validator was [more conservative](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65394#issuecomment-541499219) about values which have a mutable references to them being dropped. This was not a regression since mutable references aren‚Äôt yet allowed in a const context.
            - I have a PR to [suppress the ICE](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65485) in this particular case.
    - Enabling `if` and `match` in const contexts is soft-blocked on implementing [#63812](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/63812) and removing the old validation/promotion logic entirely. Everything required has been implemented, but it is desirable to simplify  `qualify_consts` before trying to add new features.
        - Someone should write an Inside Rust blog post detailing the progress here (I can do this if no one else wants to, but I hate my writing‚Äîit‚Äôs too verbose).
            - We could add a link to the post to the validator mismatch ICE message, explaining why this weird thing is happening to your code.
* [x] RFC 2753 ‚Äî unwind/ffi interaction ‚Äî kyle/adam
    - https://github.com/BatmanAoD/project-ffi-unwind/blob/Pre-Langteam-Sync-10-17/langteam-sync/report-2019-10-17.md
* [x] ‚Äúdyn trait‚Äù stuff
    - #57893 [](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)‚Äî [Coherence can be bypassed by an indirect impl for a trait object](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)
    - object safe for dispatch PR is r+‚Äôd
    - however, no real progress on the core cycle. Ugh.
* [x] #63599 [](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63599)‚Äî [Stabilize RFC 2451, re-rebalance coherence](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63599) @Nicholas M

    * [ ] #65355 ‚Äî [Stabilize `!` in Rust 1.40.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65355)
        * [ ] Niko started creating a kind of [‚Äúsummary writeup‚Äù](https://hackmd.io/3VA7vpBFQZCZFjhVSh4O-A), but didn‚Äôt get very far yet.
    * [ ] #65338 ‚Äî [[WIP] Add implicit named arguments for fmt macros](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65338)
        - Petrochenkov asks: ‚Äúis this lang‚Äù?
            - Centril read the actual code for the macro and noted that
                - It takes full advantage of diagnostics infrastructure so it cannot be implemented in standard library really
                - It uses def_site spans which are not stable.
                - Although this macro isn‚Äôt an attribute, derive and built-in attributes have been a lang issue and Centril things that should remain so (also because e.g. `#[default]` would interact with default field values).
                - Happy to share with T-Libs tho on the macro :)
        - [KodrAus suggests:](https://github.com/KodrAus) ‚Äúthis wants an RFC‚Äù?
        - Petrochenkov notes that: "The hygiene question is pretty simple here - inherit the identifier span from the string literal (at least the hygienic context part of it, the location can probably be made more precise). Looks like the PR does exactly that.‚Äù
    * [x] #65244 ‚Äî [add IntoFuture trait and support for await](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65244)
        - outstanding design question ‚Äî two associated types for symmetry with `IntoIterator`? (Seems good?)
        - diagnostics are already unreadable so they get longer so a bit more unreadable but they were already unreadable.
    * [x] #65188 ‚Äî [Stabilize `const_constructor`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65188)
        * [ ] One of pnkfelix, joshtriplett, and/or withoutboats should check their boxes :)
    * [ ] #64694 -- [Fully integrate derive helpers into name resolution](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64694)
        * [ ] Felix just FCPed this ‚Äî can they explain stuff?
    * [x] #64325 -[- Stabilize nested self receivers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64325)
        * [ ] One of pnkfelix, joshtriplett, and/or withoutboats should check their boxes :)
    * [ ] #64273 -[- Stabilize attribute macros on inline modules](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64273)
        * [ ] Some questions arose:
            - what happens with `mod foo;` in functions, when a proc-macro is applied to the function?
            - what is the driving use case here, if any?
                - In general, we were not sure if it made sense to to stabilize modules ‚Äúpart-way‚Äù ‚Äî i.e., before all cases are resolved ‚Äî unless there is a strong use case
                    - Why are we doing it part way?
                - Concerned that users might find the ‚Äòfranken-rule‚Äô confusing
            - why not `#![attributes]` on modules?
        * [ ] (Centril is bummed about using a visitor in this way to do the gating‚Ä¶ easy from a compiler impl POV but hard from a spec pov‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs temporary tho)
    * [x] #62514 -[- Clarify `Box<T>` representation and its use in FFI](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/62514)
        * [ ] Ping from triage @Nicholas M  üòõ 
* [ ] [Nominated issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang+)
    * [x] [Casting a function reference to a pointer producing an invalid pointer (0x1)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65499)
        - when you do `&foo` you get a reference to a zero-sized value (`foo` is a fn)
        - when this is cast to a pointer, we give you `0x1` after some PR
        - before you used to get a kind of random pointer ‚Äî importantly, it did not point to an actual function
        - somebody noticed somehow
        - ‚Äúseems ok‚Äù
        - Conclusion: wontfix
    * [x] 6[5490](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65490) ‚Äî [Restore ability to write pattern bindings after/under `@`s](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65490)
        - we removed ability to do `foo @ Some(bar)` patterns because old AST-based borrow checker couldn‚Äôt handle them
        - we can restore that now with NLL (which is what this PR does)
        - anybody object? do we need an rfc? 
            - conclusion: no but we would like a ‚Äústabilization report + FCP‚Äù
    * [ ] [Extend overlapping ranges lint to cover cases with more than a single element overlapping](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65477)
        - [#64007](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64007) introduces an overlapping ranges lint that triggers only if the beginning or the end overlap with another arms' pattern, like in `0..10`/`9..20`. [There should be a conversation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64007#issuecomment-542628737) on whether it should also trigger when the overlap is beyond that, like in `0..10`/`5..15`.
    * [x] [rustfix: Autofix try! macro in edition lint to use `?` operator](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65148)
        - we migrated from `try` to `r#try` because of subtle inference interactions (`try` assumes result type is `Result`, `?` does not)
        - some people have a bunch of code with `r#try`
            - [rustfmt has some feature to replace](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/blob/master/Configurations.md#use_try_shorthand) `[try!](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/blob/master/Configurations.md#use_try_shorthand)` [with](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/blob/master/Configurations.md#use_try_shorthand) `[?](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/blob/master/Configurations.md#use_try_shorthand)` [already](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/blob/master/Configurations.md#use_try_shorthand) 
        - should we change anything here?
        - conclusion: no. it‚Äôs complicated, it‚Äôs going to introduce bugs. Just use rustfmt.
            - wontfix.
    * [ ] [Incorrect undefined behaviour on static references created from pointers?](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63197)
        - we have a ‚Äúconst eval group‚Äù sort of happening ‚Äî maybe we can tag it for them to resolve at some point?
    * [x] [Consider deprecation of UB-happy `static mut`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53639)
* [ ] [Nominated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)
    - [WIP: "C panic" ABI specifier](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2753) ‚Äî plan is to close this
    - [Calling methods on generic parameters of const fns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2632)

# Main topic proposals
- Data:
    - Relatively minimal data
    - Crater run didn‚Äôt test objc and was a long time back
- Options:
    - Keep current behavior
    - Alter behavior but mitigate
        - can have a lint which is allow by default
            - that warns whenever fallback occurs
            - how to make it precise to this change?
        - 
    - Change over at edition boundary
        - challenging because it‚Äôs hard to detect 
- What is the strong argument in favor for this?
- When does fallback apply:


    fn foo() {
        let x: _ = panic!();
        bar(&x); // here `x` is unconstrained
    }
    
    fn bar<T: Debug>(x: &T) { }


- Question:
    - Do we need to make the fallback change at the same time?
        - Stabilize (only) the never type: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58184
- Why do we feel `!` is important?
    - No need to have everyone have their own empty enum
        - could have every empty enum coercible, but we decided against it
    - Get the coercion
    - Also `fn foo() ‚Üí !` is ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù
- Conclusions:
    -
