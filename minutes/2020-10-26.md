## Project board review

Review the [Lang team project board](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2) and get updates

## Nominated RFCs
- "RFC: -C export-executable-symbols" [rfcs#2841](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2841)
- "RFC: Supertrait item shadowing" [rfcs#2845](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2845)
    - scott prepared an update that said "this is what I expected" 
    - scott was ready to move to FCP but wanted to wait for boats
    - boats is in favor =)
    - **scott to fcp merge**

## P-high issues on rust-lang/rust
- "New "warning incompatible with previous forbid in same scope" error" [rust#77713](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713)
  - Mark has produced [a summary comment with a proposal](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713#issuecomment-716649814)
  - One concern: we should not weaken behavior of forbid in nested scopes, that should remain a hard error
  - Scott: to me, if you say allow/forbid/warn/deny, it's fine to get warnings, the important thing is that the "forbid" is the one that wins
      - What about forbid with "warn" in a nested scope? Would leave those alone.
      - Key constraint: saying forbid at some level means forbid applies within, no matter what else you say at that level
  - **Mark to implement and see how it turns out**

## Nominated PRs and issues on rust-lang/rust
- "Tracking issue for #[cfg(target_has_atomic = ...)]" [rust#32976](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32976)
    - request for prioritization
    - what people probably want here is `cfg(accessible(...))`, really
    - **Mark to leave comment**
- "Tracking issue for `X..`, `..X`, and `..=X` (`#![feature(half_open_range_patterns)]`)" [rust#67264](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67264)
    - continued discussion
    - potential confusion about what `..X` means but that meaning is stable
    - `(..5).contains(&y)` should be same as `match y { ..5 => ... }`
        - patterns though are more common
        - and people are often trying to avoid caring if it is signed or unsigned
        - but it's not just `contains`, also look-ups in btrees etc
        - integer overlap checking is relevant too -- if you have an arm for negative cases, you'll get a lint
            - but maybe you are just not handling negatives by accident, and you don't realize the oversight
        - could use a clippy lint (or other lint) for signed cases using `..X` patterns
    - stabilization for `X..` case is not controversial, let's start with that
        - `..X` is comparatively rare
    - if you wanted to write type-agnostic code, and we supported associated constants fully, you could do something like `Bounded::MIN .. X` where `Bounded` is a trait implemented for `i32`, `u32`, etc
    - **scott to summarize this comment and make a call to action**
- "`use dep1::foo as dep1` is considered ambiguous" [rust#77586](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77586)
    - [revisted crater impact](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77586#issuecomment-712888954) prompted Mark to suggest that we should keep this at least for Rust 2018 edition
    - [petrochenkov indicates it is not too hard to maintain](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77586#issuecomment-714758171)
    - another possibility is to add a lint at some point to suggest folks add `::`, this would be required if we wanted to do an edition
    - another example below, presumably this errors?
    - **niko to leave comment recommending we revert the change for now**


```
pub mod foo {
    pub use dep1::foo as dep1;
    use xyz as dep1;
}
```

- "repr(transparent) on generic type skips "exactly one non-zero-sized field" check" [rust#77841](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77841)
    - niko floated a [specific proposal](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77841#issuecomment-716575763) to treat structs as equivalent to `()` if they contain only 1-ZSTs
    - check your boxes or raise objections
- "regression: target_feature no longer permitted in some places" [rust#78143](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78143)
    - **decided to accept this as a bug fix**

## Nominated PRs and issues on rust-lang/rust that we didn't get to

- "Add checking for no_mangle to unsafe_code lint" [rust#72209](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72209)
    - [scott proposed merging](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72209#issuecomment-692859048) some time back
- "Switch `mutable_borrow_reservation_conflict` lint to deny by default" [rust#76104](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76104)
    - [update from Ralf](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76104#issuecomment-713151373):
        - in short, forbidding pre-existing borrows may be helpful but it may also not be sufficient, too early to tell
- "Add built-in implementations of `Default` for function definition andâ€¦" [rust#77688](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77688)
    - make zero-sized closures, function types implement Default
    - convenient but makes Default "well known" to the compiler
- "consider assignments of union field of ManuallyDrop type safe" [rust#78068](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78068)
    - "Assigning to Copy union fields is safe because that assignment will never drop anything. However, with #77547, unions may also have ManuallyDrop fields, and their assignments are currently still unsafe. That seems unnecessary though, as assigning ManuallyDrop does not drop anything either, and is thus safe even for union fields."
- "Rename `overlapping_patterns` lint" [rust#78242](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78242)
