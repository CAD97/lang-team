- Niko to comment on [Casting or adding type ascription to panic!() triggers unreachable_code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67227)

## Triage

[~~**P-high issues**~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AP-high+label%3AT-lang)

- [~~Usage of erroneous constant can be omitted on nightly and beta #67083~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67083)
    - [~~Replace our fragile safety scheme around erroneous constants #67191~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67191)
        - Question at hand: when does an erroneous constant become an error?
        - One option: if borrow check would consider a usage of the constant live
            - Josh was concerned, but [now agrees](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67191#issuecomment-572740539), upon further reflection
- `[~~Pin~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)` [~~is unsound due to rogue Deref/DerefMut implementations rust-lang/rust#66544~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)
    - Scheduled meeting for Jan 6th, which we had.
    - Have a [pending PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68004) with a fix — let’s discuss briefly?
        - Positive witness for negative case
        - `impl<T: ?Sized> !DerefMut for &T`
        - `impl<T: ?Sized> !Clone for &mut T`
        - fcp merge for this change, introduces the `negative_impls` 
- ~~Coherence can be bypassed by an indirect impl for a trait object~~
    - (see above)

[~~**Nominated PRs**~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

- [~~permit negative impls for non-auto traits #68004~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68004)
    - (see above)
- [~~mem::zeroed/uninit: panic on types that do not permit zero-initialization~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66059) ~~#66059~~
    - no updates since [last meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/blob/master/minutes/2019-12-19.md)
    - TL;DR of what we said before
        - Centril thinks it would be good to have the full plan as "prose" and FCP that one so we don't have to re-FCP every step.
    - Update: [crater regressions categorized](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66059#issuecomment-568445970)
    - Who will follow up with Ralf? Maybe centril?
    - To land this PR we need: (Centril to leave comment)
        - Preliminary write-up of the rules around which types permit zero-initialization
        - Something we can point to to help people understand when `mem::zeroed` and `mem::uninitialized` will panic
        - (To what extent was this covered in an RFC? Maybe only "suggested"? "Inspired by?")
    - Centril to write a comment (see action items)

[**Nominated issues**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang+)

- [~~`Pin` is unsound due to transitive effects of `CoerceUnsized` #68015~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68015)
    - split off from the other `Pin` issue
- ~~(request) Extend~~ `~~#[must_use]~~` ~~to Pin~~ [~~#67387~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67387)
    - Niko to summarize their concerns, note the `Deref` trait, and generally encourage doing something for pin now and considering a more general extension separately
- [~~Casting or adding type ascription to panic!() triggers unreachable_code~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67227)
    - Centril listed some options
        - author gave feedback.
    - Niko to write comment: let’s accept this.
- [~~Add configurable, per-item instruction limit for CTFE~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67217)
    - would prefer if you are able to attach these definitions to the const fn *definition* more than the use, in contrast to with macros --Niko
    - current infinite loop detector is very slow
- [~~PartialEq implementation for RangeInclusive is unsound~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67194)
    - [this is due to unsound specialization implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67194#issuecomment-565595437)
    - what do people think we should do here?
        - revert this particular case, presumably
        - should we try to implement some more rules here?
    - should we do an audit?
        - would be work to organize — we could write up the heuristic rule
    - Niko to leave a comment.
- [~~Pin~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)~~`~~ [~~is unsound due to rogue Deref/DerefMut implementations #66544~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)
    - see above
- [~~Tracking issue for RFC 2645, "Transparent Unions and Enums" #60405~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60405)
    - centril is thinking of stabilizing `#[repr(transparent)]` for enums:
        - Nice to have univariant enums & structs behave the same way in general as a form of "algebraic data types" are sane.
    - `#[repr(transparent)]` applied to a univariant enum behaves as if it were a struct
    - defer stablization for unions
    - Centril to write up a stabilization report & proposal for just enums.
- [~~Arc::drop has a (potentially) dangling shared ref #55005~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55005)
    - still nominated, planning to schedule a meeting
    - Let’s have a design meeting.
- [~~Tracking issue for RFC 2091: Implicit caller location #47809~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47809)
    - nominated because anp has implemented this and would like to extend to trait items, which (contrary to what we previously thought when RFC was accepted) don’t seem to pose much difficulty
    - niko requested a summary of impl strategy for rustc-guide plus reference where appropriate, but the belief is that this is generally straightforward
        - I *believe* this works by a modification to the Rust ABI, and when we make a fn pointer we generate a small shim around it, so that as long as you do static dispatch, it works fine, and dynamic dispatch (either through `dyn` or `fn` type) will “cut the chain”, but I’ve not read all the PRs. —niko 
    - conclusion: let’s do it, even though we don’t have a lot of folks here
- [~~floating point to integer casts can cause undefined behaviour #10184~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184)
    - [last time we talked](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184#issuecomment-559538629), we concluded that it made sense to
        - adopt saturated semantics as the default
        - maybe offer a `-Z` flag to opt out for a time
        - there has been plenty of discussion in the meantime
        - how do we go forward here?
            - a summary might be an amazing contribution --niko
    - Centril will leave comment asking for a summary of:
        - recommended option from the POV of the summary maker and why :)
        - what options have been evaluated and what were the results
        - what options exist that have not been evaluated and what are the pros/cons

[**Nominated RFCs**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

- [~~Calling methods on generic parameters of const fns~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2632)
    - We can continue with nightly experimentation without the RFC merged.
        - Experimentation is happening.
    - Want another meeting? (Monday, 17/18:00 PM)
- [~~Make the turbofish syntax redundant~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2544)
- [target_feature 1.1](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2396)
    - Centril wants someone to more convincingly say they’ll implement this.
        - Centril will ask T-compiler on Zulip.
