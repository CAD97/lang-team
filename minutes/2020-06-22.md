## Notes from meeting:

**FFI-Unwind**


- Not inclined to revisit questions like keyword notation (at least Niko is not)
- Would rather not have `"system"` mean unwind if `"C"` excludes unwinding, would want to have a consistent opt-in
- Could we have a lint for `#[unwind(allowed)]` that warns if the ABI does not permit unwinding?
    - We are going to remove this attribute but it’ll require some sort of transition period as people are using it today (on nightly).
    - Ideal:
        - Make this imply the newer ABI
        - Warn and encourage folks to migrate to the newer ABI

**Issue 72012**


- Soundness problem with target feature
- Reviewed the various solutions proposed
    - Unsafe to reference without calling
        - this breaks existing code but is also a more complex fix to implement, somewhat “unnatural” to not be able to refactor `foo()` to `let x = foo; x()`
- “Fast fix”
    - functions that declare “target feature” do not implement `Fn` and friends
- Josh’s ideal alternative
    - it is “unsafe” for functions that declare “target feature” to implement `Fn` and friends
        - i.e., you can only use this implementation in an unsafe block
        - but this is not an option (today) because it is a concept that the language supports, it would be like an impl that is unsafe to use
    - or — it is only possible within a function that has the same target feature set
        - it’s ok that functions can escape in this case because you’ve already “demonstrated” that you are capable of supporting those target features
    - conceptually these are kind of “impls” with where clauses that test the environment (“am I 
- Observation:
    - you can kind of model the “preferred” solution using closures, but not quite, because closures aren’t allowed to use the target feature of their enclosing item ([example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=eaf22b1eb397b52b5c312d1a9de347c7))
        - answer is probably yes
- Niko’s proposal:
    - Accept the PR that says fns with target-feature declared do not implement the Fn traits
    - Address the question of closures and what target features they have available, which also provides a workaround for the above case
    - If in the future we wish to do so, we can create some conditions under which fns with target-feature may implement the Fn traits (backwards compatibly), but it involves adding some new concepts to the trait system (e.g., impls usable only with a given target feature in scope, or unsafe impls).


    // Example of escaping:
    
    #[target_feature(enable="avx")]
    fn use_avx() -> Box<dyn Fn()> {
        let x: Box<dyn Fn()> = Box::new(also_use_avx);
        x
    }
    
    #[target_feature(enable="avx")]
    fn also_use_avx() {
        println!("Hello from AVX")
    }
    
    fn main() {
      let y = use_avx();
    }


    //
    
    #[target_feature(enable="avx")]
    fn use_avx() -> Box<dyn Fn()> { }
    
    
    impl … { // For the type of `use_avx`
        #[target_feature(enable="avx")]
        fn as_fn(&self) → impl Fn(…);
    }
    
    fn main() {
      let y = unsafe { use_avx.as_fn() };
    }
    
    #[target_feature(enable="avx")]
    fn another_avx() -> Box<dyn Fn()> {
      use_avx.as_fn() // no unsafe needed
    }
