### "Tracking Issue for const-initialized thread locals" rust#84223

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84223

* What is the change?
    * Macro looks for `const { expr }` and changes the code that gets generated
        * gets generated to `static FOO: ... = <expr>`
* Why this change?
    * Codegen improvement: the initial value of a thread-local is constant and not re-evaluated per thread
* Expected outcome?
    * We stabilize the macro and eventually move it to use inline constants
* What is the risk?
    * Currently accepts `const { ... }` syntax but desugars to a `static`
    * If set of expressions accepted as initial value for a static diverged from set that can appear in `const { ... }` this would be weird
* Niko to start FCP and summarize the above

### "Stabilize built-in attribute macro `#[cfg_eval]`" rust#87221

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87221

* https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87221#issuecomment-921099435

```rust=
// `cfg_attr` is evaluated first, and written second so the lint is reported
// however, we cannot reorder the attributes because `my_trait_helper` is not in scope before `#[derive(MyTrait)]`
// but we can use `cfg_eval` to both evaluate `cfg_attr` and keep relative order of `MyTrait` and `my_trait_helper`
#[cfg_eval]
#[derive(MyTrait)]
#[cfg_attr(my_feature, my_trait_helper)]
struct S;
```

* Niko to leave a comment explaining why it seems like there isn't really a motivation:
    * For derive, we are still going to have it, so it's just a workarond for a dumb lint? Why not make lint smarter?
    * For other users, maybe they'd prefer to have the expansion occur in the lint, like derive, as that is more convenient?
    * What exactly *is* the proposed lint?
* Wait! We misunderstood. Felix clarifies that the goal here is to move towards a future where things are "fully configured by default".
    * And this is an "eager opt-in" in advance of the new edition.
    * But that design isn't baked: it needs opt-out.
        * So are we ready to be stabilizing?
* Niko to write a comment and reach out to petrochenkov to understand what's the plan here

### "Port clippy lint `redundant_field_names` to compiler" rust#87512

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87512

* Niko to fcp close as this is not a "bug fix"-oriented lint.

### "Which patterns on union fields should be considered safe?" rust#87520

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87520

* Someone needs to look really close

### "Make all proc-macro back-compat lints deny-by-default" rust#88041

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88041

Nothing to discuss.

### "Unactionable "field is never read" warning for printed structs with the Debug derive" rust#88900

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88900

* Discussed before, Niko left a comment
* Action item: Close issue as no change is expected

### "Stabilize `const_raw_ptr_deref` for `*const T`" rust#89551

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89551

Questions to be raised on thread:

* WWRD? (What Would Ralf Do?)
    * We should document:
        * My only concern with const raw pointer deref is how and where to document that type-punning loads (i.e., raw-ptr-based transmutes) of pointers to integers are considered UB during CTFE.
    * [Answer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51911#issuecomment-930692813)
        * But just from an implementation perspective I can't think of any reason how raw ptr deref could screw us now that we have stabilized transmutes and union field accesses. The reason we only stabilized unions and transmute first is that those were already allowed in const (outside const fn).
* Why separate `*const` from `*mut`? Do we expect a difference in semantics, or is this just being very cautious?
    * Ah, [this was discussed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89551/files#r722039223), but what is the "backdoor"?
        * The reason I split it is because mutable references are unstable. If mutable pointer dereferencing is stabilized, doesn't that effectively open a back door?
    * Is it "you could coerce a `&mut` to a `*mut` and dereference that?"
* Niko would like to request a pointer to documentation about the limits of UB in const code (per [Ralf's comment here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51911#issuecomment-930692813)); in general, we need edits to the reference for what you can and can't do in const code

### "Document using liveness to infer auto traits for async blocks" reference#1088

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/pull/1088

* We discussed this before and requested a PR describing current state
    * https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/pull/1093 was opened in response
* This can be un-nominated, as eholk and I discussed this PR and felt like it might not be the right approach anyhow
* Felix to review https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/pull/1093
