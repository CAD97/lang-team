~~~~
- PR implementing syntax for const bounds landed `?const Trait` 
    - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67820
    - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68140

**ffi-unwind (BatmanAod)**

- no update but continued plan to work on writing up the [notes from big meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66037)

**"dyn Trait" stuff (nikomatsakis)**

- Relevant issue: [rust-lang/rust#57893](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)
- Relevant PR: [rust-lang/rust#66037](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66037)
- What the PR implemented:
    - Making `dyn Trait` not `dyn safe` if:
        - there is a dyn overlapping impl and 
        - the trait has associated non-functions
            - that do not have where `Self: Sized` (not implemented)
- Crater impact virtually negligible, but the 1 item we did identify is interesting
    - has to do with the `[TryStream](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/stream/trait.TryStream.html)` [trait](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/stream/trait.TryStream.html),  which is used roughly like this:
    trait StreamX {
        type Item;  
    }
    
    trait TryStreamX: StreamX  {
       type Ok;
       type Error;
    }
    
    impl<S, T, E> TryStreamX for S
        where S: ?Sized + StreamX<Item = Result<T, E>>
    {
        type Ok = T;
        type Error = E;
    }
- the crate in question has a `dyn TryStream` which is an error now
    - Why? The concern is that `S` in the above impl might (in the future) become
        - `dyn TryStreamX<Ok = A, Error = B> + StreamX<Item = Result<C, D>>`
    - in which case `type Ok` would be `A` from the default impl but `C` from the impl above
- I’m not sure if there is some path forward apart from breaking `dyn TryStream`, which is a bit of a shame
    - note that a trait alias is really what we *want* here

**grammar (qmx)**

- no update

`**never_type**` **(**`**!**`**) stabilization (nikomatsakis)**

- [PR #68350](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68350) remains open but we are [losing faith in the approach](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68350#issuecomment-579059372) that was initially suggested
- Problem is that a function like
    - `fn make_foo<T>() → Result<(), T> { Ok(()) }` is fundamentally fine
    - but if the `T` happened to “fall back” to `!`, we would issue a warning here
- Aaron1011 proposed a more aggressive lint that works across functions
    - Niko has stated he’d prefer a [more modular (intraprocedural) analysis](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68350#issuecomment-579120263)

[**Nominated PRs**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

- [Syntactically permit attributes on 'if' expressions #68658](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68658)
    - “This PR permits attributes on 'if' expressions ('if-attrs' from here on) syntactically, i.e. during parsing. We instead deny if-attrs during AST validation, which occurs after all macro expansions have run.”
    - Means that we accept code where the attributes are ultimately stripped:
    #[cfg(FALSE)]
    fn foo() {
        #[allow(warnings)] if true {}
        #[my_custom_attr] if true {}
    }
    - However, we still reject code where the attributes remain (without a feature gate? —ed):
    fn builtin_attr() {
        #[allow(warnings)] if true {}
    }
- [Add lint for never type regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68350) #68350
    - see notes above
    - revisit next week.
- [~~permit negative impls for non-auto traits #68004~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68004)
    - currently blocked on centril’s concern

[**Nominated issues**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang+)

- [`Pin` is unsound due to transitive effects of `CoerceUnsized` #68015](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68015)
    - split off from the other `Pin` issue
- [~~Pin~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)~~`~~ [~~is unsound due to rogue Deref/DerefMut implementations #66544~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66544)
    - see above
- [~~Arc::drop has a (potentially) dangling shared ref #55005~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55005)
    - meeting planned for Feb 10
- [~~floating point to integer casts can cause undefined behaviour #10184~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184)
    - [last time we talked](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184#issuecomment-559538629), we concluded that it made sense to
        - adopt saturated semantics as the default
        - maybe offer a `-Z` flag to opt out for a time
        - there has been plenty of discussion in the meantime
        - how do we go forward here?
            - a summary might be an amazing contribution --niko
    - Centril will leave comment asking for a summary of:
        - recommended option from the POV of the summary maker and why :)
        - what options have been evaluated and what were the results
        - what options exist that have not been evaluated and what are the pros/cons
        - Not done yet.

[**Nominated RFCs**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

- RFC for unsafe blocks in unsafe fn [#2585](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2585) 
    - Recent activity but generally positive sentiment from lang team members
    - Do you ever want a `unsafe fn` with no unsafe blocks in the body?
        - Yes: consider `Vec::set_len`, though unsafe fields might obviate this
        - If we had unsafe fields, we could probably give warnings if you have an `unsafe` fn with no `unsafe` blocks
    - Do we wish to merge?
    - What about `#[unsafe]` attribute as an alternative, opt-in syntax?
        - concern: `unsafe` is a keyword.
        - concern: “two ways to do it”
        - motivation?
            - avoiding breakage
            - `unsafe` keyword continues to be reserved for “(truly) here be dragons”
    - Rightward drift:
        - If you make a more narrow rewrite like `let x = unsafe { foo() }` that will help somewhat (we ought to be able to automate this, too)?
        - Maybe if you are writing a lot of smaller functions...
    - Niko: thoughts on potential edition interactions
        - side note: (re)consider `unsafe` vs `trusted`
        - I do like having the split between introduce and discharge keywords, like we have with `async.await`, so would in principle be in favour of `trusted{}` blocks, though who knows if it’s worth the churn — scottmcm
            - churn is indeed the main counterargument from my POV — nikomatsakis
    - Fighting rightward drift:
    unsafe fn foo() = unsafe {
       ...
    };
    fn foo() = match some_expression_here {
       ...
    };
    fn foo() = try { ... };
    
    fn foo(x: u8) -> u8 = x * 2 + 4;
    - Cluster of inter-related proposals here:
        - unsafe within unsafe fn body
        - fn body after `=`
            - fights rightward drift
        - unsafe fields
            - permits warning if unsafe is not used within fn body
    - Potential immediate steps:
        - Remove the lint that says “don’t add `unsafe` into the body”
            - maybe add a lint that warns if you do something `unsafe` in the body that is allow-by-default, so folks can opt-in
        - Consider whether to land the RFC
    - Compromise?
        - retool the RFC to a lint that warns by default?
        - this permits people to opt out in specific, FFI-like scenarios, but gives people a nudge
        - we can still have an automated transition, it could later become stronger etc
    - I’ll note that `fn foo(x: u8) -> u8 { x * 2 + 4 }` is already legal and fine and not materially longer, unlike in C# where the `=>` removing the `return` and `;`  (and the `get{}` in properties) is more materially valuable — scottmcm
        - it’s not obvious to me that  `= x * 2 + 4` should be allowed, it might be something we limit to “the sorts of things that don’t require `,` in a match”, for example — nikomatsakis
    - Resolved:
        - Remove the existing lint
        - Add a allow-by-default lint for unsafe code in an unsafe fn without an unsafe function
        - Write a comment on #2585 that summarizes the conversation from meeting
