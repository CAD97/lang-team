### "warn on must_use use on async fn's" rust#89610

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89610

Mark to write a comment saying lang team has no objection to adding this warning until such time as `#[must_use]` on an async function works (if ever).

### "Re-enable debug checks in `copy[_nonoverlapping]`" rust#90012

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90012

Discussed and left a comment. General feeling is that this is a "best effort" check and it's ok to go forward, but we were not clear on the overall limits of the extent to which miri can check this.
