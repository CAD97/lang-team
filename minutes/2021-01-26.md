## Process change proposal

- For design meetings, switch to the approach the compiler team uses: one meeting per month used to get a handle on current design goals and manage a queue of upcoming design meeting topics. (Rather than spending time scheduling those in triage meetings, or out of band, or not at all.)
    - expectation: design meeting document prepared Friday before the meeting so folks can read it
    - template
        - summary
        - key questions
        - details

- Move synchronous project-group checkins to the first part of that monthly "meta-design" meeting, to make more time for triage in the triage meetings, and to allow for those project group updates to lead into scheduling design meetings for a full project update. Asynchronous project-group checkins can still happen via Zulip. We could also have a label visible on the project board for projects with updates, or similar.
    - Proposal: we will ping folks on Friday before that meeting and ask for updates to be posted by Wed morning

- Ideas to change script
    - sort new first
    - change formatting
    - maybe scrape comments?

## Pending proposals

- "Stop ignoring trailing semicolons in a macro body when a macro is invoked in expression position" [lang-team#70](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/70)
    - mark as accepted and close, we just need a PR, felix to track the work
    - ACTION ITEM: Niko to comment to the above
- "MCP: Deref Patterns" [lang-team#77](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/77)
    - seconded by scottmcm
    - per the [proposed process], this authorizes creation of a zulip stream to work on drafting a charter
    - scottmcm is willing to serve as a liaison
    - need a lead :)
    - ACTION ITEM: scott to reach out and see if chorman0773 or others are keen to push on this
        - If they don't respond by next week, we'll close and encourage them to reach out when available

## Nominated RFCs
- No nominated RFCs this time.
- rylev posted [RFC 3067](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3067) for public macro rules
    - not sure how to fit this into our agenda, wanted to make folks aware
    - biggest issue:
        - Timing: what should be done in Rust 2021 vs Rust future edition?
        - Danger: if we target Rust 2024, having an "intermediate state" in 2021 could persist for a while
        - Two semantics:
            - macro-rules behaves like any other item (either 2021, 2024, requires migration)
            - macro-rules with `pub`/`pub(...)` behaves like any other item, but without pub behaves as rust 2015/2018
        - Question:
            - Do we want to expose the latter semantics if the former is not available until Rust 2024?
            - Not probably lang team's job to decide whether it gets into 2021, but it is our job to settle this
    - ACTION ITEM: Niko to create a project for tracking this

## P-high issues on rust-lang/rust
- "regression 1.50: deny after forbid breaks build" [rust#80988](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988)
    - In FCP to close
    - ACTION ITEM: scottmcm to cancel FCP, per the resoluton below
- "beta regression: forbid(warnings) interacts poorly with common derives." [rust#81218](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81218)
    - Opened to discuss the specific issue of derive breaking with forbid, which came out of 80988; this is the one part of 80988 we want to consider separately.
    - Bad user experience that using `#[derive]` with `#[forbid(warnings)]`
    - Pattern we are observing in practice:
        - derive generates an allow, this allow (now) generates an error when interacting with the previous forbid
    - Potential action
        - if a lint is forbidden, issue a lint warning for attempts to override the lint level (but otherwise ignore them)
            - complication: if this defaults to warn, then forbid(warnings) will cause problems
            - in macro-generated code, suppress altogether?
        - suppress stylistic lints in macro-generated code (or at least cross-crate macros)
            - some macro authors may wish to see lints
    - Alternative potential action
        - Special case `forbid(LG)` where LG is a lint group, or just `forbid(warnings)`:
            - Future compatibility warning (and ensure the future compatibility warning isn't turned into an error by `forbid(warnings)`)
            - Treat as if it were deny warnings (except for the previously listed future compat warning, which would be treated as `warn`, not `deny`)
            - In the tracking issue, we can tighten the screws over time
    - Why?
        - This has been the behavior since 2015 and we shouldn't break people without some transition period
    - ACTION ITEM: Felix to make this happen in some form

## Nominated PRs and issues on rust-lang/rust
- "Tracking issue for RFC 2535, 2530, 2175, "Or patterns, i.e `Foo(Bar(x) | Baz(x))`"" [rust#54883](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54883)
    - I think this can be "un-nominated", but there is a pending pr [rust#79278](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79278) with an [in-progress stabilization report](https://hackmd.io/oczPRxyBSKOAojC1Dgxupw) -- niko
    - ACTION ITEM scottmcm to take a look at the stabilization report on rust#79278 and ping mark-i-m
    - Related concern by petrochenkov: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54883#issuecomment-742802350
        - Should we allow leading `|` in patterns anywhere we allow or-patterns
        - ACTTION ITEM Josh to open an issue and do an fcp merge
            - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81415
- "Lint for unused borrows as part of `UNUSED_MUST_USE`" [rust#76894](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76894)
    - warns for `&expr;`, may be incorrect if `expr` results in an unsized type.
    - this is the case for indexing or dereferencing, for example `&slice[..]` and `&*boxed_unsized`.
    - this only applies to explicit borrows using `&`.
    - have to assess how we feel about the [crater results](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76894#issuecomment-709457991)
        - About 15000 new warnings in the ecosystem.
            - Many of those are from the same crates. The warnings seem legitimate.
        -  ðŸ“Š 35 regressed and 6 fixed (124983 total)
    - There doesn't appear to be a pattern that is used all over the place, but rather some number of specific crates that use particular patterns in their generated code.
    - Questions for ecstatic-morse or others to consider
        - Do we know why pin-project is using this lint?
            - Can we get a new version released before we land this?
        - Do we know why embedded-hal is triggering this lint?
    - if `fn foo() -> &i32 { &whatever }` then there's no warning for `foo();`, but if that were moved into a macro `foo!();` this'd warn for the unused `&`.
    - ACTION ITEM Niko to leave a comment summarizing the above
- "CString lifetime warning incorrectly fires" [rust#78691](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78691)
    - false warning in lint that was uplifted in [#75671](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75671)
        - in particular, when using `foo(Cstring::new().as_ptr())`, since the temporary lives until the end of the expression
    - how to resolve?
        - Can we detect this case and handle it separately?
        - Should we attach this to a new lint (which could be allow-by-default)?
- "expand/resolve: Turn `#[derive]` into a regular macro attribute" [rust#79078](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79078)
    - this was updated to feature gate procedural macros that come after derives
    - pending FCP completed, we have consensus
    - Do we need to wait for the 10-day period, or can we just merge this (once the merge conflicts are fixed)?
- ""!" is the only type that is unsafe to raw-ptr-deref into a "_" pattern" [rust#79735](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79735)
- "Unsafe checking skips pointer dereferences in unused places" [rust#80059](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80059)
- "Promote 2018 warn lints to deny in Rust 2021" [rust#80165](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80165)
    - Being split out into separate PRs for each proposed promotion, to make it easier to review.
- "make const_err a future incompat lint" [rust#80394](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80394)
- "relax adt unsizing requirements" [rust#80726](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80726)
- "Visit more targets when validating attributes" [rust#80920](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80920)
- "don't gratuitously error on tests returning Result with lifetime" [rust#80934](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80934)

    - ACTION ITEM Check your boxes!

    - discussed at length above
