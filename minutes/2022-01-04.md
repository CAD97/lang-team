(Meeting attendees, feel free to add items here!)

- Meeting timing
    - How does this slot work for everyone?
    - pnkfelix has a periodic conflict, nikomatsakis doesn't love Wednesday
    - Josh would like to have it on Tuesday to try and "group things together"
    - Felix/Niko would prefer Tue/Thu
    - Josh would prefer Tue/Wed
    - Next step: setup a doodle-y thing
- Planning meeting
    - Let's face it, we're not able to get status updates at present
    - Niko will propose a meeting to talk over the "planning meeting" system specifically
    - Retro lessons: did we plan on doing follow-up?
        - Mark: I think there were some proposals that Josh filed
        - Niko/Josh: That's all a blur
        - Mark: Main thing I remember was "talk to other teams about what lang can do for them"
        - Niko: Ah yes!
    - Josh: I propose that if we don't have a full month, we continue with backlog triage
- https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/lack-of-mut-in-bindings-as-a-deny-by-default-lint/15818/
    - Josh: this thread was opened over the holidays
        - don't need to dive into the proposal itself but it's an example of a thread that continues for an exceedingly long period of time with people talking past each other and not making new arguments
            - seems tied to those cases where folks aren't sure whether, if they stop talking, "something terrible might happen"
        - thread was ultimately locked by mods, not because it was nasty, but because it was "excessively exhausting" and was reported to mods
        - seems like the kind of thing that would be best solved with a lang team summary
        - doesn't mean we have to take an official position, but a design note might be worthwhile to capture pros/cons
        - could use a lint policy here around "when should things be hard errors or not"
        - something we or mods can cite that says
            - we are not going to take into account the quantity of arguments from any particular people
            - looking for new arguments, new points of view
            - in other words, if you stop talking rather than continuing on, that will not change the outcome
            - might help people to de-escalate more easily
        - I think it's a recurring pattern that folks are worried the lang will change if they don't do something about it
            - they're protective about rust, as are we all, this can produce unintentional heat
        - there were blog posts several years ago that did a "long form version" of this
    - Niko: What I would like is if we had some way to "flag" an internals thread as "Ready for design note"
        - at that point, any comments that are not working on drafting the note would be removed
        - this would be a way to take an interesting thread and bring it to lang team attention
        - the expectation would be that, absent this, lang team doesn't see threads 
    - Josh: to repeat
        - somebody could start writing something
        - and others can contribute and say "yeah I feel represented by that"
    - Niko: right, and key point is
        - "lang team will not see this, the way to have it potentially make an impact, is that people prepare a design note"
    - Mark: There may be a useful intermediate step of "drop by Zulip and get a lang team member to say 'yeah, this should be a design note'"
    - Niko: agree, I didn't mean to imply that every internals thread ends in a design note, but that when there HAVE been particularly active threads with arguments around some hypothetical point, this is the process for persisting that
    - Josh: Lang team members could also post such a suggestion to the internals thread themselves
        - Perhaps we need a standard template paragraph to say "please make a design note"
    - Mark: once you're making a design note, it feels like you don't have to explicitly say "only new arguments please"
    - Josh: not suggesting don't talk, but I think there's value in saying "a great many POV have been expressed in this thread; this thread doesn't have to come to a consensus, but the goal is to capture the unique arguments, not convince everyone else you're right"
    - Mark: I think a more general policy that we could move towards is like
        - "consensus is not the goal of internals threads"
    - Niko: yes! There has been this question of "what is the role of internals", and being able to say "the role of internals is to elaborate pros/cons and to generate design notes and design proposals" would be useful

## Proposed FCPs

**Check your boxes!**
### "Change location of where clause on GATs" rust#90076

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/90076

* Stalled on basis of "what decision criteria should we be using", not blocked on checking boxes
* Niko: What do you think is the right next step, Josh, should you and I circle up?
* Josh: Seems like yes.


## Active FCPs
### "negative impls integrated into coherence" lang-team#96

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/96

* pnkfelix as liaison should just set this up the way the other groups are setup

### "Positional Associated Types" lang-team#126

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/126

* have had a follow-up summary (thanks Felix!)
* prepared to move forward on an experimental basis
* don't need to move it in meetings, just need to figure out the setup
* mark: I think the one thing we wanted was that the person doing the impl could acknowledge the concerns
* niko: I'd sort of like to see them summarize the concerns or lay out some basic plan -- was it sam sartor?
    * I don't know what that plan would look like but I think the best would be "we'll implement and try it" to start
* mark: even ack'ing that would be good
* josh: posted a comment
* pnkfelix: I didn't take the time to attribute different points to various people, but I think that in the Zulip thread, Sam said that (i.e. acknowledged some of the concerns)
    * is the gh issue a conversation point
* nikomatsakis: I think what I'd like is for someone to create the repository and summarize the concerns there so we can agree they are faithfully represented
    * then we can create the tracking issue and move repo to rust-lang
* josh: happy to work with the proposer to get this in the right place
    * what is the appropriate place to track things?
* niko: have a specific proposal, which I just said
* josh: I'm wondering if repository is the correct answer, but we can discuss async
* niko: ok

## P-critical issues

None.

## Nominated RFCs, PRs and issues
### "Make `unused_lifetimes` lint warn-by-default" rust#92386

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92386

* forbid for crater in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92413

* joshtriplett: mark suggested would be good to make this error-by-default and do a crater run 
    * was blocked on cargo 
* cramertj: what is lang team action item?
* joshtriplett: in general changing the level of a lint would be a lang question
    * we are allowed to make it allow -> warn but there is a question of real-world impact
* cramertj: we had discussed before having a long-standing policy of which lints become allow/warn/deny and which ones belong in rustc vs clippy
    * is deciding whether this should be warn just a matter of applying existing policy?
    * or are we doing this ad-hoc?
* nikomatsakis: I don't think we have fully documented said policy although I think we have agreement on the broad shape of it
* cramertj: I think it'd be useful to be able to mechanically say whether it meets these requirements
* simulacrum: the main reason I nominated it was that I hoping we would have crater results but that didn't materialize
* cramertj: would a crater result indicating where the warning triggers a sign we wouldn't do this?
* simulacrum: I was expecting crater data may give hints -- maybe it's not a false positive, but we don't want a lint
* joshtriplett: right, might've wanted to tweak the lint slightly if some cases seem fine or could use better diagnostics
* nikomatsakis: the number of hits doesn't seem like the releavnt thing, but if you examine the cases, you might find that they all look like bugs, or not
* joshtriplett: deliberately looking for a "Huh, that's funny"
* nikomatsakis: should we just defer this? I do agree with what cramertj had to say about a policy
* Defer this issue until we get crater results
* Agreement that we should draft a general policy for when to lint at what level
* nikomatsakis: filed https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/132 and pinged rylev because he was driving work on this around Rust 2021 time
