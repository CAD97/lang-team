## Project board review

Review the [Lang team project board](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2) and get updates

## Nominated RFCs
- "RFC: -C export-executable-symbols" [rfcs#2841](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2841)
    - no updates here from compiler team
- "RFC: Supertrait item shadowing" [rfcs#2845](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2845)
    - did we plan to rfcbot fcp merge?
    - scott to fcp merge
- Backlog bonanza
    - Niko to go through and assign things to people, or people can go and pick things off
    - Via comments on the paper doc

## P-high issues on rust-lang/rust
- "New "warning incompatible with previous forbid in same scope" error" [rust#77713](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713)
    - awaiting implementation

## Nominated PRs and issues on rust-lang/rust
- "Operators in patterns have incorrect priorities" [rust#48501](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48501)
    - `&0 .. 10` in an expression is `(&0)..10`
    - `&0 .. 10` in a pattern is parsed as `&(0..10)`
    - scottmcm [nominated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48501#issuecomment-718170922) because it is relevant to stabilizing `..=` patterns
    - Consensus:
        - precedence for `..` and `..=` should match in all contexts (i.e., `&0..=10` in a pattern would be parsed as `&(0..=10)` but in an expression as `(&0)..=10`)
        - ideally yes expressions and patterns would also equate but that can be addressed separately, we would be open to proposals (that is #48501)
- "Tracking issue for `X..`, `..X`, and `..=X` (`#![feature(half_open_range_patterns)]`)" [rust#67264](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67264)
    - some discussion around aggressive linting for patterns ([context](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37854#issuecomment-718036042))
        - seems appealing but orthogonal, need not block stabilization
- "Add checking for no_mangle to unsafe_code lint" [rust#72209](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72209)
    -  include `#[no_mangle]` and `#[export_name]` in `unsafe_code` lint since it can be used with linker to cause problems
    - limited crater impact
    - [fcp merge since sep 15](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72209#issuecomment-692859048)
    - why is this not in fcp? try to figure this out
- "Switch `mutable_borrow_reservation_conflict` lint to deny by default" [rust#76104](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76104)
    - tl;dr
        - stacked borrows doesn't currently handle 2-phased borrows very elegantly in any form, even with this restriction
        - but intuitively this restriction may yet permit more aggressive optimizations
        - however the impact of removing this lint would be 117 regressions
            - but this merits investigation
            - niko to try to investigate
- "`use dep1::foo as dep1` is considered ambiguous" [rust#77586](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77586)
    - wanted to call attention to [this example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77586#issuecomment-716796251) and some of the subsequent discussion
    - Consensus:
        - Revert the PR and preserve causality, we can address this in an edition if we want
        - Suggest lint that rewrites these 'time-traveling' cases into "absolute form"
            - i.e., cases where a glob name is imported, used, and then overwritten
        - Mark to leave comment
- "Add built-in implementations of `Default` for function definition andâ€¦" [rust#77688](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77688)
    - Proposal: for zero-size function definition types, zero-capture closures, implement `Default`
    - Motivation: [thunks](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77688#issuecomment-718300101)
    - Some discussion about `FunctionPointer` trait but I think that's a [red herring](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77688#issuecomment-720500831)
    - Questions and discussion:
        - Would closures be `Default` if all their upvars are `Default`? (similar to how they are `Clone` if they are `Clone`....)
            - Not obvious that the closure makes sense to use `Default` values, the values which were captured may carry constraints (e.g., an integer that is assumed not to be zero)
            - There is something analogous with zero-sized closures, where the closure should only exist if you get to a certain point in the control flow
            - Does "observing the type" of a closure give you the ability to *call* it? (And *create* it)
        - How do we think about Default?
            - Some think of it as `new()`
            - Some think of it as something else
        - Alternative: safe-transmute from `()`?
        - Lang-team 
- "repr(transparent) on generic type skips "exactly one non-zero-sized field" check" [rust#77841](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77841)
    - still in FCP
- "repr(transparent) should not consider non_exhaustive types as 1-ZSTs outside their crate" [rust#78586](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78586)
    - semver issue around 1-ZSTs and the like
    - with non-exhaustive this is definitely undesirable
    - but if you have a private (zero-sized) field you can get a similar pattern
        - and this was the standing pattern for a long time (and arguably still is)
        - but just `PhantomData<T>` field is totally a valid pattern
    - could lint (at minimum) for zero-sized types from other crates
    - scott to "help wanted" and describe what we want
- "consider assignments of union field of ManuallyDrop type safe" [rust#78068](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78068)
    - still in FCP


### We did not get to these agenda items

- "Rename `overlapping_patterns` lint" [rust#78242](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78242)
    - this renames `overlapping_patterns` to `overlapping_range_endpoints` to address the confusing description of the lint, as discussed in [#65477](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65477). This probably requires an FCP, or a sign-off.
- "Apply `unused_doc_comments` lint to inner items" [rust#78367](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78367)

These doc comments do not get a lint, but also do not get rendered, is that a problem?

```rust
fn main() {
	/// Doc comment, no warning
	fn inner() {}

	/// Another doc comment, no warning
	struct Foo {}
}
```

- "[librustdoc] Only split lang string on `,`, ` `, and `\t`" [rust#78429](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78429)
    - currently we permit things like `foo&bar`
    - this is [unlike other systems](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78429#issuecomment-718340447) although there is little overall agreement
    - pending RFC
