# T-lang meeting agenda

* Meeting date: 2020-09-14
* [Watch the recording](https://youtu.be/0tl30zIVJoU)

## Pending proposals
  - "MCP: per-edition preludes" [lang-team#44](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/44)

## Project board review

Review the [Lang team project board](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2) and get updates


## Nominated RFCs
  - "Safer Transmute" [rfcs#2981](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2981)

## P-high issues
  - "Coherence can be bypassed by an indirect impl for a trait object" [rust#57893](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)

## Nominated issues and PRs
  - "Use implicit (not explicit) rules for promotability by default in `const fn`" [rust#75502](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75502)
  - "Permit uninhabited enums to cast into ints" [rust#76199](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76199)
  - "Lint on implicit ABI in extern fn and extern 'mod'" [rust#76219](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76219)
    - Impact is non-trivial, we likely want to land this as an edition lint targeting 2024 (warn in 2021)
    - Niko and Josh: would not want to warn without a machine fix
    - Consensus from meeting:
        - Land PR with allow-by-default
        - FCP a PR that makes it warn-by-default and has a machine-applicable rustfix, also tie it to 2021 Edition
    - Mark to post comment on the PR

## Ad-hoc topics

* boats: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2984
    * Niko had proposed a design meeting on [RFC 2580](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/55)
    * [RFC 2984](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2984) ties this to extern types
    * Consensus from before was that we did not want to add a (static) notion of "truly unsized" as opposed to "dynamically sized" (`?Sized` today).
        * If we wanted to settle the behavior towards this interpretation, we would stabilize some aspect of extern types and modify the functions to panic (probably).
    * Consider a project group around custom DST?
        * How much is this a priority *now*?
        * Also, this may overlap with the interests of folks from safe transmute group. 
        * Parsing and protocol applications often require both safe transmute and consist of interesting data structures where you have variable length with a fixed header and that sort of thing.
        * Same approach of trying to find a "minimal kernel" so that we can push more and more into the crate ecosystem.
    * Good to connect to priorities
        * e.g., "safer unsafe" code
        * C++ interop, perhaps?
    * Point being that you can do a lot of this stuff with grody unsafe code but to do with safe code you need extensions to the language
    * Consensus from this meeting
        * We are interested in seeing this space move forward
        * But still skeptical of introducing new `?DynSized` trait for the extern use case
