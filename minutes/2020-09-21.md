## Project board review

Review the [Lang team project board](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2) and get updates

## raw_ref_macros

There was a proposal to stop using `GetElementPointerInBounds` for references that go through raw references (e.g., `&(*x).y` where `x: *mut T`). May remove some optimization potential, but makes code work more easily. There might even be an option for LLVM to add `GetElementPointerNoWrap` or some intermediate variant.

Simon’s blocking concern seems to be an orthogonal concern for a feature that can be added in the future:

- `&x.f` is UB if `f` is a packed field with an unaligned offset today, regardless of whether `x` is a valid reference
- supporting “offset of” is indeed a plausible extension and we should talk about it, but it’s a backwards compatible change, and need not block progress here
    - some of lang team is in favor of making `raw_ref!((*n).f)` work where `n` is null but we should consider it separately

Mark to write comment on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73394

## Nominated RFCs
- "Destructuring assignment" [rfcs#2909](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2909)

Last time we talked about this, there was controversy about ref and binding modes. The RFC now skips that and is narrowed to a subset of pattern matching. Ready for lang team sign-off.

## P-high issues on rust-lang/rust
- "Coherence can be bypassed by an indirect impl for a trait object" [rust#57893](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)
## Nominated PRs and issues on rust-lang/rust
- "Permit uninhabited enums to cast into ints" [rust#76199](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76199)


## Meetings:
- This Wed → backlog bonanza
- Next: https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/55
- Contact authors of paper from https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/53 and see if they’re interested in talking to us and on what schedule
