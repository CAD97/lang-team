* Others: simulacrum, Alex, lcnr

## Before meeting checklist

* [ ] Update the project board with new proposals
* [ ] Update the project board with new RFCs

## Pending proposals
- "Add a `NOOP_METHOD_CALL` lint for methods which should never be directly called" [lang-team#67](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/67)
    - plan to close today
- "Stop ignoring trailing semicolons in a macro body when a macro is invoked in expression position" [lang-team#70](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/70)
    - pnkfelix willing to serve as liaison

## Project board review

Review the [Lang team project board](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2) and get updates

## Nominated RFCs
- "RFC: Checking conditional compilation at compile time" [rfcs#3013](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3013)
    - this is ready for FCP, according to RFC authors
    - tracks the set of valid cfg features etc so that we can give warnings for typos
    - only tangentially lang, it's mostly a "quality of implementation" concern as lang semantics are not changed
    - conclusion: lang is generally in favor of this, willing to remove T-lang and leave the details to cargo/compiler, scottmcm to comment
- "Adds `must_not_await_lint` RFC" [rfcs#3014](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3014)
    - conclusion:
        - niko to issue fcp, modulo bikeshed
        - bikeshed can be resolved in appropriate zulip stream e.g. #wg-async-foundations

## P-high issues on rust-lang/rust
- "New "warning incompatible with previous forbid in same scope" error" [rust#77713](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713)
    - check boxes on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78864 -- cramertj, withoutboats, joshtriplett

## Nominated PRs and issues on rust-lang/rust
- "expand/resolve: Turn `#[derive]` into a regular macro attribute" [rust#79078](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79078)
    - some backwards incompatibilities
    - `derive(Copy, Clone)` optimization may be affected
    - Question about: "For historical reasons `#[derive]` fully configures its input, eagerly evaluating cfg everywhere in its target, for example on fields."
        - is this new behavior?
    - Perf impact?
    - Josh to move to FCP, kick off rustc-perf run, cc libs team because it's part of prelude
- "Add built-in implementations of `Default` for function definition andâ€¦" [rust#77688](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77688)
    - waiting on checkboxes
- "Support `pub` on `macro_rules`" [rust#78166](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78166)
    - still want this to be part of a plan
    - the issue of how to transition `macro_rules` with no qualifier (so as to make it equivalent to `pub(self)`)
    - there is reluctance to stabilize `pub macro_rules` unless the default behavior is also changed, at least in a new edition
        - could e.g. change behavior of `pub macro_rules` in earlier editions but just have the behavior of `macro_rules` with no qualifier change in Rust 2021
        - may need to do this for edition purposes
- "Rename `overlapping_patterns` lint" [rust#78242](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78242)
    - [check your boxes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78242#issuecomment-730176176)
- "Apply `unused_doc_comments` lint to inner items" [rust#78367](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78367)
    - Niko to fcp close
- "Add #[must_bind] attribute and lint" [rust#78715](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78715)
    - Follow up regarding what docs are needed to do to get started
- "Accept arbitrary expressions in key-value attributes at parse time" [rust#78837](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78837)
    - Question: feature-gate? exposed to proc-macros perhaps?
    - Expansion order for macro usages, is that exposed to procedural macros?
    - Perhaps interaction with name resolution and hygiene (what does `foo::bar` mean)
    - Niko to post question about how stable this becomes
- "passes: prohibit attrs on generic params" [rust#79073](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79073)
    - crater run found no regressions
    - pnkfelix to fcp merge
- "Acknowledge that `[CONST; N]` is stable" [rust#79270](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79270)
    - scott to fcp merge
- "conditional fallback for the `!` type" [rust#79366](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79366)
    - Niko explains the idea
    - `Err(22)?` -- the ok type defaults to `()` unit today
- "Add unstable #[may_ignore] attribute to cancel #[must_use]" [rust#79572](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79572)
