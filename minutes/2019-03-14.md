    - We do not presently have a good way to model the current 2PB behavior
      - So the PR proposes a conservative static check
    - Case in question
      - `let p = &x;` // pre-existing borrow
      - `x.push(*p)` // `x` is mutable borrowed here, so can’t use `p` w/o changes
    - Levels
      - No 2PB
        - “basic stacked borrows”
      - Restricted 2PB (this PR)
        - “small diff” from the previous
        - disallows case in question
      - Full 2PB (present stable)
        - represents a **big change** from the previous
        - not sure how to handle this yet:
          - very permissive rules, with few optimizations
          - complex rules, with more optimizations but more expensive dynamic checks
    - Proposal (this one)
      - Treat this as a bug in rustc, more powerful than we intended
      - Introduce a future-compatibility warning for this case
        - this would add be added to an existing set of warnings
      - [Regressions have been tested:](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/58739#issuecomment-470230949)
        - 1 duplicate between github and crates.io (elba)
        - 3 root regressions of crates.io crates
        - 1 crates.io crate with reverse dependencies (by the same author)
        - 13 github only crates
    - Alternative (reject PR)
      - Treat this as a bug in the model
      - But we don’t know whether a model exists that satisfies the following criteria:
        - gives room for 2PB
        - permits the optimizations we want
        - is comprehensible to humans
      - Perhaps effect might be limited to 2PB
    - Observations
      - important to buy us time, getting a model is an important point
      - crater breakage is “tip of the iceberg”
        - existing code demonstrates that people try to write this
      - reality is that over time we fix bugs, and impose semantics
        - so we do warning transitions in any case
      - reality is that there are other sets of changes that cause breakage
        - e.g., adding `AsRef` impls and other inference breakage
      - there was a meeting that we planned to treat it as a bug
    - Proposal
      - Issue a Future Compatibility lint with the issue + lint
      - Phrase the text of the message carefully
      - Retrospective + plans to prevent this from happening again

# Unsafe code guidelines 

[Link to the writeup](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/blob/master/working-groups/unsafe-code-guidelines/notes/2019-03-14.md)


## RFCs and what form it should take

@centril: many RFCs seems more feasible than one

- allows more detail-oriented and focused discussion
- e.g. RFC for tuple representation

**Proposal:**

- Two interlinked outputs
  - Reference
  - Justification, drawbacks, and other considerations
    - (pros & cons, motivation, etc…)


## Language features
- Identify the needs and try to keep them written


## Dynamic checking
- Core principle: want to ensure that there is a nice way to run dynamically testing
- Useful for programmers, but also researchers
  - lets you do verification, though efficiency matters less there
- Currently using miri
  - this could be considered an artifact for us to stabilize
- Areas of concern?
  - Recursive verification of validity checks could be much more expensive
    - we could make this configurable, but we would lose some precision
    - How deep are our references? Finding out may guide decision
    - Seeing how much code breaks when using deep references vs shallow might be interested data — nikomatsakis
  - Stacked borrows has to do a lot of checks
- We should clearly identify where what miri checks diverges from the spec
  - and, in each case, have a good argument for why that is


## “Breaking” changes
- didn’t get to this!
## Next area to focus
- given 
## Tuple layout (cramertj has concerns =)
