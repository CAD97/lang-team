# T-lang meeting agenda

* Meeting date 2020-10-12

## Attendance

* Team members: Niko, Scott, boats
* Others: simulacrum, Lokathor, areredify

## Before meeting checklist

* [x] Update the project board with new proposals
* [ ] Update the project board with new RFCs

## Pending proposals

* "MCP: pub(macro)" [lang-team#59](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/59)
    * inclined to place in FCP for close because:
        * macros are imperfect, we know, but
        * this problem was meant to be solved by hygiene
        * adding syntax doesn't make solving it easier
        * we'd rather wait and address macros 2.0 / hygiene more holistically
* "Restrict promotion to infallible operations" [lang-team#58](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/58)
    * we would like an RFC that pulls together the overall plan
    * supercedes old promotion RFC, builds on explicit syntax recently introduced
    * role of this RFC is to surface this change to the community and document/justify it
    * doesn't block implementation PRs from landing
        * like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77526
  
## Project board review

Review the [Lang team project board](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2) and get updates

## Nominated RFCs
  - "Safer Transmute" [rfcs#2981](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2981)

## P-high issues on rust-lang/rust
  - No P-high issues this time.

## Nominated PRs and issues on rust-lang/rust
  - "Tracking issue for experiments around coercions, generics, and Copy type ergonomics" [rust#44619](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44619)
      - Mark to move this content to a design note in the lang-team repo
      - We are still open to project proposals in this area but the issue isn't serving much function
          - probably what's required is implementation  experimentation
  - "resolve: Do not put nonexistent crate `meta` into prelude" [rust#75802](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75802)
      - un-nominated, no update
  - "Switch `mutable_borrow_reservation_conflict` lint to deny by default" [rust#76104](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76104)
      - Niko to leave a comment and we can circle back next week, would be good to have Josh around
  - "passes: `check_attr` on more targets" [rust#77015](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77015)
      - Discussed the question of whether we should revisit our backwards compatibility policies
          - in particular, this is clearly a bug fix but we could choose to make it a deny-by-default lint nonetheless and phase in (e.g.) over an edition boundary if we really wanted a hard error
      - For now decided to land this change but to revisit this topic in future
      - If there is more breakage than anticipated we are happy to back out
  - "`use dep1::foo as dep1` is considered ambiguous on nightly but not beta" [rust#77586](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77586)
      - Seems like a bug, we are content to let it ride the trains as it was recently introduced
      - No crater data, but the person who made the report is ok with the breakage
      - The ambiguity error makes sense to us
      - Again highlights the need for a more explicit policy around these sorts of decisions
  - "New "warning incompatible with previous forbid in same scope" error" [rust#77713](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713)
    * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70819 was the original issue being fixed, was fixed by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77534
    * In Rust 1.42, if you put `-Funused` and `-Aunused` on the command line, it was interpreted as a forbid and resulted 
    * But in code, putting two attributes at the crate level was ignored (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70819)
    * This code is in nightly but not in beta yet
    * Consensus points
        * definitely we should forbid in the crate if there is a forbid at the top level
            * because: if someone writes `forbid(unsafe_code)` and then someone PRs in some small line with `warn(unsafe_code)` on a module and then allow(unsafe_code) on an unsafe usage, that's really not what the person who wrote forbid wanted
            * note though that cap-lints does mean that you can't rely on forbid as a had guarantee (but also means that dependencies don't break)
        * top level should not be special, all levels should behave the same
        * we should at least warn, and maybe error, for `forbid` followed by `allow`
        * we can either accept, warn, or hard error for `allow` followed by `forbid`
    * On order dependence
        * There was some surprise at the idea of order dependence for top-level items
        * However other forms of attributes are order dependent (e.g., procedural macros)
