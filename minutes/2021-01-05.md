# T-lang meeting agenda

* Meeting date 2021-01-05

## Attendance

* Team members: Josh, Taylor, Niko
* Others: simulacrum, mara

## Before meeting checklist

* [ ] Update the project board with new proposals
* [ ] Update the project board with new RFCs

## Pending proposals
- "Stop ignoring trailing semicolons in a macro body when a macro is invoked in expression position" [lang-team#70](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/70)

## Project board review

Review the [Lang team project board](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2) and get updates

### Inline assembly

https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/20

* If we plan to stabilize inline assembly, we need to set a timeline. We've got a decent amount of experience.
    * We've been gaining experience, seems like it has evaded the problems of exposing too many LLVM internals. Still some things that need fixing but they are not backwards incompatible.
    * May want to stabilize target-by-target
        * Start with x86, x86-64, probably arm
        * But not the "longer tail" of tier 2/3 targets
    * Action item:
        * Josh to get started towards stabilization report

## Nominated RFCs
- No nominated RFCs this time.

## P-high issues on rust-lang/rust
- No P-high issues this time.

## Next week's design meeting

This week's topic: Weak refcounted pointers, dangling, alignment, and long-term implications for custom DSTs.

Guest: Christopher Durham

https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80407

* Turned out to be an unexpected consequence around the handling of dangling pointers and sized types. 
* Reverted the change for the release, with plan to address tomorrow
* To prepare for the meeting:
    * Read the introduction on #80407 and perhaps other background.

## Nominated PRs and issues on rust-lang/rust
- "Tracking issue for RFC 2535, 2530, 2175, "Or patterns, i.e `Foo(Bar(x) | Baz(x))`"" [rust#54883](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54883)
    - Behavioral changes have been implemented
    - Plan to do a transition for meaning of `pat` 
        - there is a pat2018 and pat2021 matcher
        - meaning of `pat` changes based on the edition
    - Stablization PR is available [#79278](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79278), needs someone to move to FCP -- scottmcm to move to fcp if they are happy
        - Need to double check that we are handling edition rules correctly
- "Support `pub` on `macro_rules`" [rust#78166](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78166)
    - no recent updates, still need to get a 'plan' put together, but not clear who has bandwidth at present
- "expand/resolve: Turn `#[derive]` into a regular macro attribute" [rust#79078](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79078)
    - performance regression of around 1% across the board, may be recoverable
        - not really a lang team concern
    - cramertj left a comment with lang-team concerns
        - you can now use derive as a way to "early evaluation" of `#[cfg]`, via a hacky workaround
            - this is because derive, unlike other macros evaluates configs; previously derive had to be listed last but that's not true anymore
            - we could continue to require derives to be listed last, if we want to preserve that contraint
            - we could forbid `#[derive()]` but of course folks can write `#[derive(Passthrough)]`
        - generally, people feel like eager evaluation of configurations would be useful however
            - but there is the concern that, depending on where the attribute appears, config attributes may or may not appear -- this is somewhat unavoidable with eager evaluation, though
            - Danger: I might write a macro that expects code with cfg applied, and because of the way I generally order my attributes, not realize that this is something I'd have to handle.
            - but what sort of bugs do we expect around cfg attributes? Most macros will simply pass through cfgs in any case, not provide 'cfg-specific' behavior.
        - main question is do we want to expose the behavior *at all* -- it seems clear we could do a better job of designing the 'config early expansion' feature
    - consensus in this meeting:
        - derive ought to be restricted in stable code to appear in the end position until we can design how we want eager expansion to occur
        - design concern:
            - want to avoid having the problem that reordering derive has a huge effect on what inputs various attributes see to the extent we can, and avoid the case where people test with one order and then code breaks with another order
- "conditional fallback for the `!` type" [rust#79366](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79366)
    - clearing nomination for now
- ""!" is the only type that is unsafe to raw-ptr-deref into a "_" pattern" [rust#79735](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79735)
    - [comments from previous meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79735#issuecomment-745506187)
- "Unsafe checking skips pointer dereferences in unused places" [rust#80059](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80059)
    - would want a PR, perhaps a warning cycle
    - pnkfelix to try and write this PR
- "Allow qualified paths in struct construction (both expressions and patterns)" [rust#80080](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80080)
    - fix for https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79658
    - current status:
        - `Foo::X` [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=7236c2a277552b3b1d0bde7e18d3ae7c) suggests changing to `<Foo as Trait>::X`
        - `T::X` does work today [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=84122764f395ec46a3991bb075fde52d)
    - untested things (not exhaustive):
        - `T::Foo { }`
    - Niko to leave comment
- "MaybeUninit requires T: Sized but it should not" [rust#80158](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80158)
    - some complex issues, doesn't feel like something we should stabilize until we have more progress on custom dst and have an answer for how this interacts
    - cramertj to leave comment
- "make const_err a future incompat lint" [rust#80394](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80394)
