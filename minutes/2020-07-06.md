# T-Lang Meeting: Current meeting

* [Watch the recording](https://youtu.be/Cajj5L7fHzw)

## Action item
- Niko to reach out to wg-grammar around writing up a “what is status” thing
- Niko to prep a write-up for [auto-trait-lifetime interactions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64552)
- scott to post comment on “elide array size” RFC
- Lower priority of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68015 and add as a blocker to CoerceUnsized
- Niko to postpone cancel FCP on [RFC 2522](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2522#issuecomment-415551732) and close as postponed, encouraging folks to consider opening an MCP for parts of the proposal and move it forward that way.

## Notes from meeting:

**Issue** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68354: mixing by-move and by-ref

Summary of what the issue is talking about:


    let foo = (String:new(), String:new());
    match foo {
      (ref x, y) => { // feature-gated today, but now works
      }
    }


    let foo = (&Some(String::new()), String::new());
    match foo {
      (Some(x), y) => { /* mixes with default binding modes */ }
    }

**FCP on PR:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74060


- Took an intentionally conservative approach around const generics in the beginning.
- This PR now implements various traits for *arbitrary* lengths, rather than only “up to the length N”.
- This commits us to the notion of having at least a private notion of const generics for usage by std.
- [Related Zulip conversation](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213817-t-lang/topic/stable.20subset.20of.20const.20generics/near/202925130).

**FCP on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73631**


- Assumption that this makes is that once you run code with a given target feature, you will always have that target feature available.
- In theory you could have some complex architecture where you have asymmetric multiprocessing that has distinct capabilities:
    - But this would break a huge amount of code in the wild that assumes you can check the CPUID once and then cache that result.
    - There has been discussion in the linux community that in such a scenario, you would get back the universal subset available, and would have to “opt in” to observing features that are specific to your sort of core.
- New type of UB: “taking a target feature away from your process after having run code that uses that target feature is UB”.
    - We could change this in the future if we need to deal with complex asymmetric multiprocessing scenarios as described above.
- Definition of the unsafe proof obligation to call a target-feature:
    - You must show that the target-feature is available while the function executes *and whatever may escape from that function*.
    - This emphasized condition is trivial in the case where cpu features never change.
    - In a hybrid architecture where cpu features can change, you would have to know whether fn and closure pointers escape and for how long. This may imply new annotations that assure you that they do not escape or perhaps adding a lifetime annotation. 
        - Lifetime annotations could also be useful for dynamic loading/unloading scenarios where functions get unloaded.

**FCP on** https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2632


- Would be nice to resolve this, we don’t normally keep RFCs open while we experiment, but we have to review the details, and would be nice to have ecstatic-morse around for this.
