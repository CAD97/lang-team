## Attendance

* Team members: Niko, Josh, scott, taylor, boats, Felix
* Others: Diggory Blake, simulacrum

## Before meeting checklist

* [x] Update the project board with new proposals
* [x] Update the project board with new RFCs

## Pending proposals
- "Add a `NOOP_METHOD_CALL` lint for methods which should never be directly called" [lang-team#67](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/67)
    - Seconded, would normally FCP the lint implementation PR
    - Might be surprising that existing code starts to lint, perhaps we want to phase this in over edition -- evaluate with crater?
        - can it be easily cargo fixed?
- "Disallow keywords as macro arguments names" [lang-team#68](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/68)
    - Seconded, but requires an edition transition and/or assessment of impact.
    - What process is appropriate
        - Proposal: separate "do we in general want to do this (and what level of impact are we comfortable with)" from "what would the impact of this be (via crater and similar)".
        - We could also immediately prevent keywords that aren't widely used, and go through a transition for keywords that are widely used.
    - We could also introduce another introducer syntax, such as `$$`, which would make it clearer at a glance whether something is a variable or not.

## Project board review

Review the [Lang team project board](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2) and get updates

## Nominated RFCs
- No nominated RFCs this time.

## P-high issues on rust-lang/rust
- "New "warning incompatible with previous forbid in same scope" error" [rust#77713](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713)
    - New PR posted, [#78864](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78864)
    - PR unifies behavior for `forbid` depending on whether it is in the same scope or different scope
        - if you try to allow a lint that has been forbidden, you get an error, but only if that would have been forbidden (so if you do cap-lints=deny, you get no error).

## Nominated PRs and issues on rust-lang/rust
- "Tracking issue for RFC 2535, 2530, 2175, "Or patterns, i.e `Foo(Bar(x) | Baz(x))`"" [rust#54883](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54883)
    - Two unresolved questions:
        - Support this notation in closure arguments (without parentheses)?
        - Modification to `$f:pat` -- should it include `|`?
            - If so, that'd be a breaking change to existing macros that may have relied on `|` not being consumed.
    - Can we move forward with stabilization?
    - Closure arguments:
        - Hard to read without parens (or even with)
        - `|Foo(Ok(x) | Err(x))|` would probably still work
    - Modification to `$f:pat`...
        - would be potentially confusing to introduce later
        - should consider a crater run to assess impact and go from there
    - Consensus:
        - encourage someone to gather data via crater run
        - Josh to leave comment
- "Switch `mutable_borrow_reservation_conflict` lint to deny by default" [rust#76104](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76104)
    - Update: revived the crater results and there are a non-trivial number of regressions, but mostly in "random github repositories"
    - Occurs frequently in repositories of people doing exercises, in particular
    - Currently no reason to keep the lint, but stacked borrows may evolve
    - Felix to examine some of the repositories and see if there is a take-away
- "Add built-in implementations of `Default` for function definition andâ€¦" [rust#77688](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77688)
    - Some recent comments
    - Other options:
        - Right sol'n is not default but some kind of trait identifying these types (things that can be called without a value)
        - Muckable in safe transmute is an option too
    - boats: If we're going to allow people to do this, we should support it in "the intuitive" way (but maybe we shouldn't do this)
        - But *is* default more intuitive than something like `FnStatic`? (Different name maybe)
    - Worth noting that you can `transmute` today from `()`, but it's unsafe as you can't say that the fn has no state
- "clarify rules for ZST Boxes" [rust#77844](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77844)
    - "LLVM's rules around getelementptr inbounds with offset 0 are a bit annoying, and as a consequence we have no choice but say that a `Box<()>` pointing to previously allocated memory that has since been freed is UB. Clarify the docs to reflect this."
    - Is this limited to something related to "provenance"? (Niko to figure it out)
- "Support `pub` on `macro_rules`" [rust#78166](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78166)
    - Supports `pub macro_rules!`
    - Not documented in PR what the overall semantics are (e.g., if `pub` is not placed)
    - Procedural:
        - Needs an RFC (to specify behavior, even if it's just "same as `#[macro_export]`") but seems exciting
        - This is a major, user visible feature, not a minor tweak
        - Is there any minor macro transition we may want to key off of this?
- "Rename `overlapping_patterns` lint" [rust#78242](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78242)
    - derived from a discussion in [#65477](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65477)
    - what it says on the tin
    - Niko to FCP
- "Crater experiment: can we remove this weird special case from promotion?" [rust#78363](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78363)
    - "Promotion has a special case to ignore interior mutability under some specific circumstances. The purpose of this PR is to figure out what changes if we remove that. Since Cell::new and friends only get promoted inside const/static initializers these days, it actually is not easy to exploit this case: you need something like"
    - crater run showed no regressions
    - Niko to FCP
- "Apply `unused_doc_comments` lint to inner items" [rust#78367](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78367)
    - Niko likes to write doc comments, and it's plausible that rustdoc could be extended to show inner items.
    - Is there evidence of user confusion? Not that we know of.
    - But compile-fail doc tests will not run, right? (false, they do).
    - Might be useful to have a mode in rustdoc to show "docs that were not generated"
    - Consensus: not inclined to make the change
- "[librustdoc] Only split lang string on `,`, ` `, and `\t`" [rust#78429](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78429)
- "Add #[must_bind] attribute and lint" [rust#78715](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78715)
- "Accept arbitrary expressions in key-value attributes at parse time" [rust#78837](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78837)
