## Notes from meeting:

**Add std::panic::panic_box. #74622** 
 

- `panic!(``"``{x}``"``)` — today this “throws” a `&``'``static str` (at least with `std::panic`)
- Proposal in Edition 2021:
    - `panic!` always throws a `String` 
        - even if you just had `panic!(``"``uh oh``"``)`, use `String` 
    - `panic_box` (or some other name) throws the value you give it
        - `fn panic_box<T>(t: T) → !`
        - `panic_with` — alternative name
    - `catch_unwind` returns `Box<dyn Any + Send>` which can be downcast to `&``'``static str` or whatever (the compiler hard codes printing String and &’static str in the panic message)
        - Could this be done without the requirement for `Box` and `String` and allocation? In theory, it would be possible for a panic handler to print and unwind without allocating memory.
        - `core::panic!` does have a different behavior, for this reason
            - `core::panic!` never captures a payload; if you panic with formatting arguments those get directly handed to the panic handler (via [PanicInfo::message](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/panic/struct.PanicInfo.html#method.message), unstable)
    - There is a “change” to ABI here in that throwing panics will now have distinct values
        - Though there is a migration that will move to `panic_box` so that folks are unaffected
- Could we just directly make `panic!(``"``{x}``"``)` (without supplying an `x`) an error in the 2021 Edition?
    - `panic!(``"``{}``"``, x)` — what you would write today
    - `panic!(``"``{x}``"``)` — is what we expect people to write
- Currently today, a special case for 1-argument panic means we don’t treat the argument as a format string.
    - This is error-prone already today, since lints etc (have to double check)
- https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=3b32e8b29b38292cc97be909ec1e03ff
    - `panic!("{}");` currently panics with the static string `"``{}``"`.
    - In the edition boundary, let’s make that a compile-time error
    - (If you *really* want that, you could always escape it.)
- Scenarios are
    - `panic!(``"``{foo}``"``)` in 2021 (where `foo` is in scope) — equivalent to `panic!(``"``{}``"``, foo)` in 2018
        - `panic!("{foo}")` in 2021 (where `foo` is not in scope) — compilation error
    - `panic!(``"``foo``"``)` in 2021 — should this be equivalent to
        - `panic!(``"``{}``"``,` `"``foo``"``)` in 2018 — i.e., raise a `String`; or
        - `panic!(``"``foo``"``)` in 2018 — i.e., raise a `&'static str`
- Argument was to make it more uniform so that
    - `std::panic` always raises a `String`
    - `std::panic_box` always raises whatever you gave it
    - `core::panic` 
- It seems clear that we need some kind of FCP?  At least a clearly defined plan.
- Also, is this lang or libs?
    - Josh: Feels like mostly a libs change but if we’re going to accept 
    - Josh: I think lang’s position and role here should mostly be “Lang would like `panic!` to be consistent with `println!` and `format!`.

(notes)

- formatting to String is delayed until the panic is actually captured, if you use `std::panic!`, `core::panic!` never goes into String, and does not preserve the payload at all
- `panic!` is purely library code FWIW
- [libcore panic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/efc02b03d18b0cbaa55b1e421d792f70a39230b2/src/libcore/macros/mod.rs#L5-L21)
- [libstd panic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/efc02b03d18b0cbaa55b1e421d792f70a39230b2/src/libstd/macros.rs#L11-L18)

 [**[CRATER] make `ConstEvaluatable` more strict #74595**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74595) 


- waiting on crater run

 [**Tracking issue for RFC 2137: Support defining C-compatible variadic functions in Rust #44930**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44930) 


- Some recent activity — is this something we could plausibly stabilize?
- Currently working on support for associated functions, so that should probably bake for a bit
- But the regular support has baked for a while, so that could be stabilized, but it’s probably not worth breaking up the feature gate
- Recommend waiting one release once the new support lands and check on tests, then stabilize?
- Josh to leave comment

**Add `oneof` configuration predicate to support exclusive features** #2962 ([link](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2962))


- New configuration predicate to with `all` and `any` meaning “exactly one is enabled”
- Useful when doing things mutually exclusive features you may wish to enable
    - e.g., mutually exclusive platform tags
- Concern: usually in those cases you want an error as the “alternative”
- Should we take this through the “MCP process” to explore the solution space
- Would Josh serve as liaison? Maybe.
- Cargo features are typically meant to be unioned, so do we want to bring in cargo people and maybe do this in conjunction?
    - If this were mutually exclusive feature flags, certainly, but this is more general
    - One reason I wanted this recently:
        - Error is `pointer-size` is neither 32 nor 64 bits
- Niko: Seems plausible but I am indeed dubious that `oneof` is the best, and that I think some kind of error macro would be a better approach
- Felix: Yes unless there is some example of a case where you want a non-error behavior…
- Note: Josh to drop nominated tag and suggest MCP to explore alternatives.


**Edition 2021**


- Draft RFC
    - https://hackmd.io/jJflujmLS_-sFPUkYo417g
    - need to fill out the addendum

**Backlog Bonanza**


- Notes: During the backlog bonanza, we went through and gathered notes on some RFCs
- Hoping to recommend things to either
    - Merge, if we have a liaison and think it’s basically the right sol’n
    - Encourage MCP if we think if it could be a fit but we don’t know about the liaison, or think more exploration is needed
    - Close otherwise

**MCP Procedure**


- Major Change Procedure:
    - Potential liaisons would assign themselves (or be assigned)
    - In this meeting, we would look quickly and tag with “charter-needed” if we had a generally positive
        - Things we thought the charter should cover
        - Note prior attempts and precedent
        - Missing stakeholders or expertise
        - Too much work and not a good fit for priorities
            - technical debt incurred
            - often the work cannot be done by “one person” but impacts larger language
- Liaison works with the PR author to write a charter
    - Template
    - Can just be a copy of the MCP
    - Opens a PR to add charter and close the issue
- Open an issue that we track
    - and they work towards an RFC
