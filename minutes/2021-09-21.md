# T-lang meeting agenda

* Meeting date: 2021-09-21

## Attendance

* Team members: Josh, Niko, Taylor, Felix
* Others: Mara, Mark

## Meeting roles

* Action item scribe: simulacrum
* Note-taker: nikomatsakis

## Additional agenda items

### [Dyn upcasting initiative, upcast safety temperature check](https://rust-lang.github.io/dyn-upcasting-coercion-initiative/design-discussions/upcast-safety.html)

* Coercing a `dyn Foo` to `dyn Bar` if `Foo: Bar`
* `*mut dyn Foo`, want to upcast to `*mut dyn Bar`
    * Question is, is it ok to have an invalid vtable?
* Can you cast from `usize` to a wide pointer?
    * [Answer: no](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=6c07a5a269c0b47ff03e8f674b3b12d8)
* `0 as *mut dyn Foo as *mut dyn Bar as usize == 0usize` ?
* Conclusion: have a design meeting with a proposal for how to resolve this question
    * Stakeholders?
        * Taylor 
        * DST folks (Simon?)
    * [Previous meeting notes](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/blob/master/design-meeting-minutes/2020-11-04-RFC-2580-and-custom-dst.md)

### ~const syntax

* Josh: Realized that there were a ton of new discussions around the "const propagation" syntax (I have this thing that has the ability to be const, so if it is const, I can be const). I noticed a lot of usage of `~const` syntax, which seemed like an unusual use of `~` and there hadn't been any discussion around it.
    * Anyone know where that is being discussed?
* Felix: I saw someone recently complaining about inability to parameterize over `&` vs `&mut`, is there potential for general purpose ...?
* Josh: Maybe, general concept might work if "if this is Send, then that is Send", seems like a propagation of bounds concept
* Niko: On the topic of "if send", check out this [evaluation](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-fundamentals-initiative/evaluation/design/implied_send.html), it covers how we might do it in chalk but also some of the complications that arise. (tmandry and I were discussing it in the context of async functions in traits.)
* Should we have an update meeting on const?
* Niko: don't have an assigned initiative or owner here, either
* Action item: Niko and Josh to talk to oli-obk

### "Proposal: Change syntax of where clauses on type aliases" rust#89122

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89122

* New this week!

Proposal. 

Change from:

```rust
type Foo<T>
where
    T: PartialEq = ...;
    
type Foo<T> where T: PartialEq = ...;
```

to:

```rust
type Foo<T> = ...
where
    T: PartialEq;
    
type Foo<T> = ... where T: PartialEq;
```

Note consistency with tuple structs:

```rust
// Compiles successfully.
pub struct Struct<T>(T)
where
    T: Eq;
```

* Felix: 
    * Would we ever want to have where in the syntax of types?
    * `for<T: PartialEq> ...` 
* Taylor:
    * Is the "precedence" of how you parse this that where has very low priority, and hence doesn't apply to part of `...`?
    * Niko: yes
* Josh:
    * If we consider where to bind to the entire statement, and not just to part of it
* Niko:
    * the where clause already exists in return types in functions


```rust=
fn foo() -> T
where...
{
}

impl<T>.... for T
where...
{
}
```

* Mara:
    * If we made `=` part of a bound (e.g., `where X = Y`), then the current syntax would be ambiguous
* Taylor:
    * We have an outstanding issue related to this for where-clauses and associated types
    * e.g. `where T::Item = u32`
    * Not *actually* ambiguous 
    * Personally I find where having "lower precedence" than equals to be confusing; we do have precedent for where clauses having low precedence, e.g., in impl blocks
        * I didn't find it intuitive the way others have
* Mara:
    * Agreed, though both seem confusing to me
* Josh:
    * Both have potential for confusion. What tipped the balance for me is that it *feels* like the `=` should be attached to the thing you are "logically assigning" (e.g., the `Foo<T>` in `type Foo<T> = `), otherwise you have some long parenthetical (the `where` clause) in the middle before you say the RHS. `where` usually feels like it wants to be something you pull "out of line" and defer until later.
    * Note that you can do `type Foo<T: PartialEq> = ...` if you want it upfront.
* Niko:
    * I think this "parenthetical" captures some of why the current syntax feels wrong to me.
* Taylor:
    * B/c you don't view the bound as a key part of the item definition?
* Taylor:
    * Both of you mentioned that you don't view it as a key part of the impl that the bound exists.
* Niko:
    * I think that would be inconsistent if we wanted to permit weakening bounds (as we discussed in the context of `unsafe`).
* Taylor:
    * I guess it just feels like a non-obvious win and we have an existing syntax. But if y'all feel strongly, that's something we could do.
* Felix:
    * My guess is that changes to the formatting rules might help

```rust
type Foo<T>
    where Constraints
    = Body;
```

* Niko to summarize the points raised on the thread

[Notable comment:](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87512#issuecomment-919368771)

> Without a lint category, it doesn't really make sense to uplift.  I think rustc should have an allow-by-default category for lints like this:
>
> * clearly more idiomatic
> * purely stylistic, non-critical, low-risk
> * lints usage of a language feature or prelude items (generally not std API usage)
> * the scope of the lint is clear and simple with no perceivable future enhancements
>
> Some candidates: `needless_return`, `write_with_newline`, `writeln_empty_string`, `redundant_pattern`, `redundant_static_lifetimes`, `single_match`, `unused_unit`
>
> There is a very large gap between rustc lints and Clippy lints in terms of stability, false positive rate, lint pickiness, opinionatedness. Of course some of the "blame" falls squarely on Clippy to fix bugs, remove un-useful lints, etc. But Clippy will likely never have the level of stability that rustc has as it is sort of a playground for new lints. A rustc lint category can bridge that gap a bit for people who want rustc to be just a little more picky, but in a highly stable way.

* Mara:
    * Seems analogous to unused imports
* Niko:
    * at least for me, dead code helps identify bugs, not this
* Scott:
    * this seems more like unused parens
* Mark:
    * I think rust-analyzer gives warning here and it's often, at least for me, due to some intermediate state
* Mara:
    * Same is true for unused imports; I think a good example is "redundant semicolons"
* Taylor:
    * Agreed that unused imports feels like a different category
    * I also would expect a lint for a bunch of semicolons in a row, for example

We already have:
```rust
declare_lint! {
    /// The `redundant_semicolons` lint detects unnecessary trailing
    /// semicolons.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// let _ = 123;;
    /// ```
    ///
    /// {{produces}}
    ///
    /// ### Explanation
    ///
    /// Extra semicolons are not needed, and may be removed to avoid confusion
    /// and visual clutter.
    pub REDUNDANT_SEMICOLONS,
    Warn,
    "detects unnecessary trailing semicolons"
}
```

* Niko:
    * We lint about unused parens? 
    * Scott: Yes
    * I think I'd be happy with this lint later.
* Scott:
    * I wonder how aggressive this is. I might not want this if 3/4 fields can't use the shorthand.
* Felix:
    * To me this would annoy me if I want to hold a place for maybe swapping in a new variable name, but it just happens to match the field name.
* Niko:
    * I generally just prefer not to have choices, I'm usually happier that way. But I'd sort of like to have rustfmt just do it without telling me.
* Taylor:
    * I feel like I want this lint, but only if rustfmt would just take care of it for me.
* Scott:
    * cargo fix takes care of it
* Taylor:
    * not a standard part of workflows
* Josh:
    * this is pretty far outside of rustfmt's wheelhouse; it generally tries not to modify your "established style". It assumes you meant what you wrote.
* Felix:
    * but it will reorganize your code. It won't remove parens?
* Mara:
    * but e.g. it does change the type of paren you use with a macro
* Taylor:
    * if I have a pile of semicolons, does it collapse them?
* Niko:
    * I agree that -- for better or worse -- rustfmt has not historically been this opinionated.
* Niko:
    * I think what we really want is just a policy that we can apply, none of our discussion here seems specific to this lint
* Taylor:
    * I think my personal preference for these sort of things is that I don't want CLI warnings, I want autofixes only
* Niko:
    * I agree with that, I feel like what I want here is an RFC declaring a "project-wide" policy of the expected workflow
* Josh:
    * I would suggest there are a few nuances
        * Does anyone feel we shouldn't push people towards field shorthand?
        * If so, is using a lint the right way, or does it generate too much noise?
* Mara:
    * Lint level called "nit"?
* Josh:
    * We have style lints now like "you didn't capitalize things"; that's an inherent style guideline we've enforced for so long. This is new though.
    * Niko: side note that we introduced those guidelines as a correctness issue, at least in part, to help folks identify constants and things in match expressions. Used to be that everything was lowercase.
* Scott:
    * I agree with Niko's previous assertion that there should be a mechanical rule, but it may not be "you should always use this if you can"
* Scott to summarize this on the thread

### "Perform type inference in range pattern" rust#88090

**Link:** https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88090

* [Summary](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88090#issuecomment-916173523)
* [Clarified](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88090#issuecomment-916261849)
* Impact:
    * We equate types *before* checking that they are chars/ints
* Result:
    * It would be harder to introduce some new form of `..` that had two different types
* Felix:
    * That would be a huge change, since `Range<T>` has only one type parameter
* Conclusion: Niko to start FCP

```rust
trait Zero {
    const ZERO: Self;
}

impl Zero for i32 {
    const ZERO: Self = 0;
}

fn foo() {
    match 1 {
        Zero::ZERO ..= 1 => {},
        _ => {},
    }
}
```

* Scott:
    * How does this impact a hypothetical spec?
* Niko:
    * Well, this is par for the course in our type checker. We are very sensitive to the order in which unifications occur. I'd like to slowly remove those places but it's the current status.
