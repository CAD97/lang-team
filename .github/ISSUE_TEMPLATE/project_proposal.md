# Proposal

## Summary and problem statement

*Describe the problem(s) this group is trying to solve as concisely as you can.*

## Motivation, use-cases, and solution sketches

*Please describe the problem you are trying to solve and give some use-cases that illustrate it.*

*Please also sketch out one or more solutions to the problem. You don't have to have all the details worked out, but it should be enough to convey the idea.*

## Prioritization

*If possible, please describe how this is related to the declared [lang team priorities]. It's ok if you don't think that the idea fits into any of the stated priorities, you can just say so. Note though that projects which don't fit into the declared priorities are less likely to be accepted, particularly if they are large in scope.*

[lang team priorities]: https://lang-team.rust-lang.org/priorities.html

## Links and related work

*Provide links to any internal thread(s), github issues, related work from other languages, or other things that are worth following up on.*

## Initial people involved

*List the people involved in this proposal so far. List also people who have done related work in the past but who are not involved, but may perhaps be interested.*

## What happens now?

This issue is part of the experimental MCP process described in [RFC 2936]. Once this issue is filed, a Zulip topic will be opened for discussion, and the lang-team will review open MCPs in its weekly triage meetings. You should receive feedback within a week or two.

**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review, indicating that you second the proposal (or third, etc), or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**
