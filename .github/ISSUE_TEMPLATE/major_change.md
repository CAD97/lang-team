# WARNING

The Major Change Process was proposed in [RFC 2936] and is not yet in
full operation. This template is meant to show how it could work.

[RFC 2936]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2936/

# Proposal

## Motivation, use-cases, and solution sketches

*Please describe the problem you are trying to solve and give some use-cases that illustrate it.*

*Please also sketch out one or more solutions to the problem. You don't have to have all the details worked out, but it should be enough to convey the idea.*

## Links and related work

*Provide links to any internal thread(s), github issues, related work from other languages, or other things that are worth following up on.*

# The Major Change Process

Once this MCP is filed, a Zulip topic will be opened for discussion. Ultimately, one of the following things can happen:

* If this is a small change, and the team is in favor, it may be approved to be implemented directly, without the need for an RFC.
* If this is a larger change, then someone from the team may opt to work with you and form a project group to work on an RFC (and ultimately see the work through to implementation).
* Alternatively, it may be that the issue gets closed without being accepted. This could happen because:
    * There is no bandwidth available to take on this project right now.
    * The project is not a good fit for the current priorities.
    * The motivation doesn't seem strong enough to justify the change.

# Comments

**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review, indicating that you second the proposal (or third, etc), or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**
