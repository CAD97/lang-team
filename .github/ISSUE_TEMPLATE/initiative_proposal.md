## What happens now?

This issue is part of the lang-team [initiative process]. Once this issue is filed, a Zulip topic will be opened for discussion, and the lang-team will review open proposals in its weekly triage meetings. You should receive feedback within a week or two.

**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review, indicating that you second the proposal (or third, etc), or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**
