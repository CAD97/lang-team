# lang-team

A home for the Rust language design team. The language design team is
generally responsible for decisions involving the design of the Rust
language itself, such as its syntax, semantics, or specification. This
repository houses planning documents, meeting minutes, and other such
things.

## Quick facts

- **Where to find us:** You can reach out to us on [Discord](about/chat-platform.md), though some working groups are on Zulip.
- **Want to attend a meeting or follow along?** See the "meeting
  calendar" section below.

## Meeting Calendar

We have a publicly available calendar that lists meetings for
lang-team working groups. To help keep conversations manageable, some
lang-team meetings are invitation only, which will be indicated in the
meeting description.  Many meetings take place using the Zoom video
conferencing software, while others are text meetings. The meeting
description should indicate that. Our meeting calendar is publicly
available from the following links:

- [CalDav Link][caldav] -- use this if you use Google Calendar
- [ICS file, for use outside from google calendar][ics] -- you probably want this otherwise
