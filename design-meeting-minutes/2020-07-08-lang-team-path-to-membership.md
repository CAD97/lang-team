# 2020.07.08 — Lang Team Path To Membership

[Recording available](https://youtu.be/SeH-hZgDG1Y)

- [Compiler-team meeting issue #32](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/32)
- MCPs are revealing, imo, a liaison shortage, and our team has been steadily reducing in number, so we need to think about recruiting
- Project group lead is a good start but it doesn’t demonstrate
    - ability to work on projects that are not your own passion
    - ability to work with others
- Path to membership that doubles also as “expectations for a lang-team member”
    - Project group lead
    - Liaison 
    - Participate regularly in meetings or in some fashion
- What is the role of the liaison?
    - Should we expect neutrality, sort of like Manish with the [Facilitator blog post](http://- https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2019/02/04/rust-governance-scaling-empathy/)?
- Do all groups need a liaison?
    - Most important typically mostly for controversial topics
    - Pre-requisite might be the number of participants
        - maybe like if the discussion is large enough, there should be a facilitator
- What are the expectations for a lang-team member? Some subset of:
    - Lead project groups, where appropriate
    - Liaison for projects, where appropriate
    - Participate in triage meetings
    - Participate in design meetings
    - Respond to rfcbot fcp requests in a timely fashion
    - Participate constructively in, and help facilitate, RFC discussion, issues, PRs, and other GitHub-based discussions
        - Provide important technical points
        - Help to drive discussions towards common understanding
            - Understanding and documenting the positions and points being raised
    - Monitor and respond to communication in Zulip
- Note that these expectations do not preclude taking vacations, or having periods where you’re excessively busy, as long as that’s well-communicated to the rest of the team.
- Desire a certain sense of generality
- Levels of lang-team membership?
    - What is the “core piece” of membership?
    - Is it checking off the RFC/FCP checklist?
        - this is certainly, in an operational sense, the *core* thing
    - Necessary but not sufficient, perhaps. We should expect participating in some subset of the things above as well.
- Working backwards from box checking:
    - the critical part is having concerns, which requires knowledge, and then communicating that concern in a way that it can be resolved
- Path to membership is to complete these things:
    - Lead one or more project groups
    - Liaison one or more project groups
    - Demonstrating capability to build consensus and encourage productive discussion
        - ideally, we’d be able to point to official summary comments and the like
- If we said that there was a role of explicit facilitation, it’d be easier to identify those comments
    - we shouldn’t expect facilitators not to have opinions, may be true but also sometimes impossible
    - but you should still be able to produce summaries
- Levels of membership
    - Is there a role like compiler team contributors that makes sense?
    - Maybe collecting liaisons etc? Is there any benefit to this? It’s not obvious what they have in common.
    - Might just be like “people who are liaison’ing, which is a really valuable contribution”
        - after N months of inactivity
    - Being able to ping for meetings is at least a useful
- MCP quality of service
    - Can we have deadlines or other things
    - Some kind of regular ping might be helpful here
        - Zulip ping @T-Lang may help
- Circling back:
    - Can we get consensus on the idea of non-lang-team liaisons and some consensus on the idea of an explicit path?
    - How do we feel about having project groups with no lang team members at all?
        - For things that are not “core efforts’, seems ok, but there are risks
        - Would be more upset to be declined if nobody is involved
        - Good idea to have clearer charter and expectations in these cases
        - We should select non-lang-team liaisons based on an expectation of good language design sense
        - Also, we would still expect that liaison person is someone we’ve had good experience with and who is committed to project, so that mitigates risk
- Next steps:
    - Write this up in the form of documentation
    - Amend MCP RFC perhaps
    - If you have people you think might be good liaisons, bring up in t-lang/private Zulip stream
